"""Pre-flight safety scan of untrusted RDF/XML and JSON-LD (research.md R3, decisions.md D9/D36).

Article V names imported RDF as untrusted input. Measured against `rdflib` 7.6's
RDF/XML parser: external entity references do not resolve (a canary file
referenced this way parses to an empty string, nothing leaked), but internal
entity expansion is wide open — eight nested entity declarations in a ~500-byte
document expand to a single 781,250-character literal, unbounded in the
document's own size (research.md R3). That is a denial-of-service route into any
deployment that lets a curator supply a file.

`rdflib.plugins.parsers.rdfxml.create_parser` calls `xml.sax.make_parser()`
itself and accepts no parser argument, so a defused parser cannot be substituted
directly. The fix is a pre-flight scan: the raw bytes are run through
`defusedxml.sax` with a do-nothing content handler first, and only reach
`rdflib` if that returns cleanly (decisions.md D9).

`rdflib`'s JSON-LD parser carries the same shape of hole by a different route
(decisions.md D36): a document whose ``@context`` is a plain string, or an
array containing one, is resolved through `urlopen` with no allowlist —
against a remote host, or against ``file://`` and any local path the process
can read. Spec Assumptions is explicit that this feature reads "a file, not a
URL"; :func:`scan_json_ld` is the same pre-flight-refusal shape applied to
that hole, refusing any document that carries a string (rather than a
locally-embedded object) ``@context`` reference before `rdflib` ever sees it.

An inline *object* ``@context`` is not automatically safe, though (decisions.md
D47): `rdflib.plugins.shared.jsonld.context.Context._read_source` reads an
``@import`` key from any dict it treats as a context — the document's own
top-level context, an array entry, a term's own nested ``@context``, or a
node's own ``@context`` inside ``@graph`` — and resolves a string value
through the identical `urlopen`-backed fetch a string ``@context`` uses.
:func:`scan_json_ld` refuses that too, wherever in the document it appears.

    (decisions.md D36/D47).

    A plain string ``@context`` names a location for rdflib to fetch and parse
    itself — the first vector this scan closes. An array ``@context`` may
    freely mix inline objects with string references, dict entries, and further
    arrays, so every entry is passed back through this function whatever its
    type; only the first offending entry is named in the refusal, consistent
    with :func:`scan_rdf_xml` naming only the first problem it meets.

    That recursion is the point, not tidiness (SEC-701, decisions.md D19). The
    array branch used to check only ``str`` and ``dict`` entries, and
    ``Context._prep_sources`` recurses into a nested array and hands each
    string inside it to ``_fetch_context``. So ``{"@context": [["http://…"]]}``
    passed the scan and was fetched, as did the same shape wrapping an
    ``@import`` object, while the flat forms either side of it were correctly
    refused.

    A ``dict`` — an inline, locally-embedded context, the ordinary shape of a
    published file — was previously left alone entirely on the reasoning that
    it "carries nothing to resolve". That was false (decisions.md D47):
    `rdflib.plugins.shared.jsonld.context.Context._read_source` reads
    ``source.get('@import')`` from *any* dict it treats as a context — the
    document's own top-level one, an array entry, a term's own nested
    ``@context``, or a node's own ``@context`` inside ``@graph`` (every one of
    those shapes reaches ``_read_source`` the same way, and
    :func:`_iter_context_values` already finds every ``@context``-keyed value
    anywhere in the document, nested or not) — and resolves a string
    ``@import`` value through the identical `urlopen`-backed
    ``_fetch_context``/``source_to_json`` path a string ``@context`` uses. So
    a dict is checked for that key too. Every *other* dict-shaped context
    construct rdflib's own ``_read_source`` reads (``@vocab``, ``@version``,
    ``@base``, ``@propagate``, ``@protected``, term definitions and their
    ``@id``/``@type``/``@container``/etc.) only ever assigns local state or
    calls :func:`_rec_expand`/:func:`_prep_expand`, neither of which reaches
    `source_to_json` or `urlopen` — ``@import`` is the only key in a context
    object that triggers a fetch, so it is the only one guarded here.
    ``None`` (no ``@context`` at all) carries nothing to resolve either and is
    left alone.
