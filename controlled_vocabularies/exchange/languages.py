"""Resolving a published language tag to a configured language (FS-007 US0).

One class owns this subject (constitution Article XV) rather than a handful of
module-level functions beside ``skos.py``'s own ``configured_language_codes()`` —
the plan's "eight comparisons" all read through :class:`LanguageMatcher` once the
stories after this one wire them up. This module imports nothing from ``rdflib``:
the graph traversal that produces a predominance ranking stays behind
:class:`~controlled_vocabularies.exchange.skos.SkosGraph`, this codebase's RDF
boundary (``research.md`` R2), so a matcher here is testable from a plain dict.

Django's own ``django.utils.translation.get_supported_language_variant`` was
measured and rejected (``research.md`` R1): it refuses any language Django ships
no translation catalog for, including one the project explicitly declares in
``settings.LANGUAGES`` — which would make this feature silently useless for the
research vocabularies it exists to serve. Nothing here consults a translation
catalog; matching is plain string comparison against the configured codes.
