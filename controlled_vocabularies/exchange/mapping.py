"""SKOS predicate -> model mapping (research.md R4).

Fixed by what R1's models already define — no new modelling, just naming the
correspondence ``skos.py`` walks against. This grows one predicate at a time as
each story in ``tasks.md`` needs it, rather than being populated up front with
entries nothing yet reads (Article II — no speculative table). User Story 1
needs only the namespace itself, plus the identity and scheme-membership
predicates it reads directly (``skos:prefLabel``, ``skos:inScheme``,
``skos:topConceptOf``, ``skos:hasTopConcept``), all reachable as plain
attributes of :data:`SKOS` without a lookup table. Labels, notes, relations,
and collections are named here once their owning story (US-3/4/5) adds the
code that reads them.

User Story 2 adds :data:`DCTERMS` for exactly one predicate,
``dcterms:description`` — SKOS defines no description predicate for a
``skos:ConceptScheme``, so a vocabulary's description is read from the same
Dublin Core term CONTEXT.md already names as the import alias for a concept's
own ``definition`` (decisions.md D21). ``rdflib.namespace.DCTERMS`` is a
built-in namespace object, so nothing new is declared here beyond importing it.

User Story 3 (tasks.md T018/T019/T021) adds the label, note, and mapping
predicate tables below, exactly the growth this module's docstring already
anticipated.

015-read-single-record T001 adds the opposite direction: given a *stored*
kind, the CURIE to key a page's row on. :func:`skos_curie` moves here from
``exchange/skos.py`` — it is a namespace concern, not a graph one, and this
module is exactly where the namespace it depends on already lives.
:data:`LABEL_CURIES` and :data:`NOTE_CURIES` are derived by inverting
:data:`LABEL_PREDICATES` and :data:`NOTE_PREDICATES` and applying
:func:`skos_curie`, never hand-written, so a predicate added to either
forward table appears in its inverse with no second edit. The relation,
scheme-membership, collection-membership and type terms invert nothing that
exists, so they are written out directly instead.
