"""The structured outcome of one import run (FR-015, decisions.md D7).

``ImportReport`` is the feature's public contract alongside the import itself: #51
groups and counts what was set aside for a curator, and #52 renders a command-line
summary and a rehearsal preview from it, neither re-reading the file nor parsing
prose (spec Acceptance Scenario US1-11). Four buckets, each inspectable as data:
what was created, what was updated, what was set aside with a reason, and what the
source no longer mentions.

A set-aside reason is drawn from the closed :class:`SetAsideReason` vocabulary,
never freeform text (Article XII, FR-016). An entry stores its reason, its
subject, and any reason-specific parameters as plain data — the same shape
:class:`~django.core.exceptions.ValidationError` uses — so the message renders in
the caller's active language at display time rather than being baked into one
language at creation time.

class SetAsideReason(TextChoices):
    """The closed vocabulary of reasons an import cannot store something (FR-014).

    Covers what the spec's Key Entities and FR-014 name: a language the site is
    not configured for, a predicate or construct the models have no place for, a
    relationship or membership end missing from both the file and the database, a
    concept with no usable preferred label, and a record claiming a vocabulary
    other than the one being imported. Not "fatal" findings (a missing or blank-node
    identity) — those fail the whole run rather than being set aside (D3, D8) and
    are not part of this vocabulary.

    ``DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_FROZEN`` (US-2, decisions.md D18/D22) is the one member
    naming a conflict at the vocabulary level rather than a value that could
    not be stored: a re-imported file's declared default language differing
    from the one already frozen on an existing, concept-bearing scheme.
    ``RELATION_DISJOINTNESS`` (review fix, decisions.md D37) names a pair
    stated, in one file or split across two runs, as both a hierarchical
    (broader/narrower) and a related relation — SKOS declares the two
    mutually exclusive (models.py ``ConceptRelation._reject_disjointness_violation``);
    the hierarchical relation always wins and the related statement is the
    one set aside. ``SURPLUS_PREFERRED_LABEL`` (review fix, decisions.md D38)
    names a preferred label beyond the first a concept carries in one
    language — the model allows only one ``PREFERRED`` row per (concept,
    language) — whichever value is not the deterministically-kept one is
    the one set aside, in the vocabulary's default language exactly as much
    as in any other configured language. ``EMPTY_SLUG`` (review fix,
    decisions.md D39) names a concept whose preferred label is made up only
    of characters ``slugify()`` strips — the label itself is fine, but the
    slug it derives is empty, which the model refuses to store; the concept
    is set aside rather than crash the run on that refusal.
    ``ALREADY_IN_ANOTHER_VOCABULARY`` (review fix 8/9, decisions.md D42) names
    a concept or collection whose identity is already held by a *different*
    vocabulary than the one being imported: moving a record between
    vocabularies is a curatorial act, never a side effect of reading a file,
    so the existing record is left exactly where it is rather than
    reassigned. ``URI_HELD_BY_DIFFERENT_KIND`` (review fix 10, decisions.md
    D43) names a URI already held by a record of a different kind — a
    collection where this file asserts a concept, or the reverse — a
    contradictory source reported while reading rather than surfacing as a
    database constraint violation (spec Edge Cases). ``NO_LANGUAGE_TAG``
    (review fix 15, decisions.md D48) names a label or note value that is
    either a plain literal with no language tag, or not a literal at all
    (e.g. ``skos:definition`` pointing at a URI) — FR-008/FR-009 both require
    a label or note to be stored "with its language", which a value carrying
    none cannot meet; the value is set aside rather than guessed into the
    vocabulary's default language, a language the file itself never asserted.
    ``VARIANT_NOT_KEPT`` (T022, FR-005, decisions.md D14) names a preferred
    label beaten by a *sibling variant* in a language contest (FR-003) —
    never ``SURPLUS_PREFERRED_LABEL``, whose message means more than one
    preferred label in one and the same language and is false for a value
    whose file carries exactly one preferred label in its own published tag.
    The two have different remedies: nothing recovers a same-language
    duplicate, while configuring the published tag recovers a contest loser,
    which is what FR-008's account exists to tell apart.
    ``VALUE_TOO_LONG`` (fix cycle 1, S6 SEC-002, decisions.md D34) names a
    label or note value the model's own field refuses on length — variant
    matching newly routes values that were previously unreachable into
    ``Concept.add_label``/``add_note``, and a single verbose alternative
    label in a hostile or merely careless file must not abort an entire
    import; the value is set aside rather than crashing the run on
    ``ValidationError`` (the same discipline ``EMPTY_SLUG`` already applies
    to the slug).

        caller never has to distinguish "clean run" from "feature absent".

        Folded case-insensitively (CORR-003/SEC-003, decisions.md D34): FR-001
        makes matching case-insensitive throughout, so ``PT-br`` and ``pt-BR``
        are one recoverable language, not two — a curator ranking by what
        configuring a language would recover must not have its vote split by
        a spelling difference RFC 5646 itself calls meaningless. The first
        published spelling seen (a run's :attr:`set_aside` order is
        deterministic) is kept as the display key.
