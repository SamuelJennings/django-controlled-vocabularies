"""The exception hierarchy for reading a published SKOS file (FS-006).

Two unrelated ways an import ends badly, which callers are documented to catch
as the pair ``(SkosImportError, SkosImportFailed)``:

- :class:`SkosImportError` — the file could not be turned into usable SKOS at
  all. Missing, an undeterminable or unsupported serialization, unparseable, or
  refused outright by the pre-flight safety scan through one of its two
  subclasses.
- :class:`SkosImportFailed` — the file parsed fine and its *content* was
  refused. Carries the run's :class:`~controlled_vocabularies.exchange.report.ImportReport`.

They are siblings rather than one subclassing the other, deliberately: catching
"unreadable file" should not also catch "readable file, rejected content".

These lived in ``safety.py`` and ``skos.py`` respectively. ``SkosImportError``
was moved into ``safety.py`` by review fix 19 (decisions.md D52) only so the
two ``Unsafe*`` subclasses could reach it without a circular import, which left
the base of the whole hierarchy — covering a missing file and an undeterminable
serialization, neither of them a safety concern — living in the safety scanner.
Collecting them here removes the cycle as the reason for a module's contents.
Both names remain importable from their original modules, so no caller moves.
