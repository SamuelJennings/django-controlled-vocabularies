"""Reading a published SKOS file into records (FS-006).

The RDF boundary: a file becomes an ``rdflib`` graph (:meth:`SkosGraph.from_file`), the graph is
walked into the models R1 built, and the run returns a structured
:class:`~controlled_vocabularies.exchange.report.ImportReport` of what it did (Article X: RDF is
read only at this boundary, never stored as a graph).

:func:`import_skos` is the module's one public entry point, a thin wrapper over
:class:`SkosImporter`. It resolves or creates the vocabulary a file declares, then imports each
concept — identity, labels, notes, relationships, and collection membership — setting aside
anything the models have no place for rather than dropping it (Article XI). The whole run is one
transaction: a fatal finding rolls the run back entirely, after every problem has been collected,
not only the first.

    numeric suffix appended only when the candidate already belongs to a *different* record. An
    unusable base (an identifier segment made up only of characters ``slugify()`` strips) is
    returned as ``""`` rather than suffixed — a caller decides what that means for its own record
    kind (a concept is set aside, decisions.md D39; a vocabulary is fatal, decisions.md D35 fix

    Shared by :meth:`ConceptImporter.assign_unique_slug`, :meth:`SchemeResolver.resolve_scheme`
    and :meth:`CollectionImporter.import_collections` — a collision in any of the three record
    kinds is the same computation (Article XV), so the shape is not duplicated three times.

    ``taken_slugs`` maps every claimed slug to its claimant's ``static_uri``, mutated in place so a
    caller resolving more than one record in the same run sees each prior assignment as taken.
    Because ``static_uri`` never changes once assigned, a record's own previously-stored slug is
    always read back to itself rather than suffixed (FR-020's "same file yields the same slugs
    however it is traversed").

    ``max_length`` (T042, SEC-002-shaped, decisions.md D35 fix cycle 3) bounds the returned value
    to the calling model's own ``SlugField.max_length`` — never a literal ``255`` written a second
    time here. A published identifier segment can be arbitrarily long; nothing on this write path
    calls ``full_clean()``, so an unbounded slug lands unchecked on SQLite and raises a bare
    ``DataError`` on PostgreSQL. The *base* is truncated, leaving room for the numeric suffix, and
    the assembled candidate is itself clamped to ``max_length`` (SEC-405, decisions.md D63, fix
    cycle 5), so the returned candidate never exceeds ``max_length`` however many collisions it
    resolves — true even at ``max_length < len(suffix_text) + 1``, where keeping one base
    character and the whole suffix would otherwise still overrun the field.

    Returns ``""`` — the same "unusable" signal an empty base already gives — rather than looping
    forever when no further collision retry can produce a candidate distinct from one already
    tried (T056, CORR-503, decisions.md D66, fix cycle 6): once ``max_length`` is small enough
    relative to the suffix text, the clamp above can make two *different* suffixes render as the

        Replaces whatever labels this concept already held: a label carries no identifier to upsert
        by, and the file is authoritative for what it contains (FR-013). :data:`LABEL_PREDICATES`
        covers ``skos:prefLabel``/``altLabel``/``hiddenLabel``; a preferred label whose *resolved*
        language is ``default_language`` (T008: compared through the matcher, not the raw published
        tag) is skipped — that slot is already ``concept.label`` (T009), and the model refuses a
        second preferred row in that language.

        A value sharing no base language with any configured one is set aside and reported by its
        own published tag, checked ahead of the write rather than letting ``ConceptLabel.clean()``'s
        own refusal raise (T020, FR-014, D25) — that exception protects a direct, out-of-band write,
        not this importer's control flow.

        A second ``skos:prefLabel`` resolving to one configured language — default or not — is the
        same shape of problem for a cardinality reason: the model allows only one ``PREFERRED`` row
        per (concept, language), so the contest is keyed on the *resolved* language and settled once
        per language by :meth:`~controlled_vocabularies.exchange.languages.LanguageMatcher.resolve_winner`
        (T013/T021) — not by grouping on the raw published tag, which let two *different* tags
        resolving to one non-default language both reach ``add_label()`` and crash the run on the
        model's own refusal, because each tag was its own singleton group and neither ever saw the
        other. This is the identical computation ``import_concepts`` already runs for
        ``Concept.label`` over the identical ``preferred_label_in`` candidates, so the two agree by
        construction rather than by coincidence (decisions.md D13). In every configured language's
        slot, default or not, a loser is discriminated by its own published tag against the tag the
        winner computation chose (T014): the same tag is a same-language duplicate and keeps
        ``SURPLUS_PREFERRED_LABEL`` (FIX 4, D38); a different tag is a losing variant and takes
        ``VARIANT_NOT_KEPT`` (T022, decisions.md D14) — the two populations have different remedies,
        which is what :meth:`~controlled_vocabularies.exchange.report.ImportReport.language_account`

        Nothing is derived from ``concept.label`` — identity's slug and the label a curator reads
        are deliberately independent, so a publisher renaming a concept never moves its address.
        ``Concept.save()`` only *refuses* a collision rather than resolving one (research R4,
        written for curator-authored content where two identifiers colliding on their own final
        segment is rare); a published file is not so well-behaved (D35), so the importer resolves
        it itself via :func:`unique_slug_for_identifier` — the same computation
        :meth:`SchemeResolver.resolve_scheme` reuses for a vocabulary's own collision (Article XV).

        ``created`` (T041, FR-020, decisions.md D35 fix cycle 3) decides whether a slug is minted
        at all: a slug is computed through :func:`unique_slug_for_identifier` only for a concept
        this run is creating. A concept :meth:`import_concepts` *matched* to an existing row
        already holds a slug — it is read back exactly as stored, never recomputed, so no change
        in what else currently occupies the scheme (a sibling deleted, a slot vacated) can move an
        address that has nothing to do with this concept's own identifier. Recomputing
        unconditionally used to be *safe* (the base is a pure function of ``concept.static_uri``,
        invariant once assigned) but not *stable*: ``taken_slugs`` is reseeded fresh from the
        database on every run, so a collision this concept was once suffixed against can vanish
        between two imports of the identical file, silently moving its address (FR-020's "same
        file yields the same slugs however it is traversed" — reread here as "however many times
        it is imported").

        ``taken_slugs`` (FIX 16, D49) maps every claimed slug to its claimant's ``static_uri`` —
        fetched once by :meth:`import_concepts` from every concept currently in the scheme
        (matched rows included), mutated in place by :func:`unique_slug_for_identifier` so the
        next *newly created* concept in the run sees a just-minted sibling's slug as taken. Because
        ``concept_nodes`` is always processed in URI-sorted order (never the order a file happens
        to declare them in), a collision between two identifiers created in the same run resolves
        identically whichever order the file is read in.

        ``slug_is_manual`` is always set ``True``, matched or created alike: it stops
        ``Concept.save()`` from re-deriving this value on a later, unrelated save — including for a
        concept the importer is touching for the first time after it was authored locally (no prior
        ``static_uri``), which otherwise keeps deriving its slug from its label (FR-019) forever.
        The caller (:meth:`import_concepts`) already sets aside a concept whose identifier segment
        slugifies to nothing (``EMPTY_SLUG``) before this method ever runs, so the base is never

        concept, because a relation is commonly asserted from only one of its two ends — an
        incremental delete-and-recreate would delete a row a sibling's own pass had only just
        written.

        A broader/narrower pair always wins over the same pair resolved as related (review fix 2,
        D37): SKOS declares the two disjoint, and the model refuses to store both
        (:meth:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.ConceptRelation._reject_disjointness_violation`).
        Broader/narrower rows are written first, each clearing any conflicting stored RELATED row
        for the same pair — not only one the bulk deletion pass above would catch, since that pass
        only considers a row when *both* ends were rewritten this run (D30), and the far end of a
        newly-stated broader edge may instead be a concept only referenced this run (D29's
        ``get_by_uri`` fallback). Related rows are written after, checked the same way against a
        conflicting BROADER row, and set aside rather than attempted when one is found.

        Run after every concept this run created or updated already has a primary key — membership
        needs :meth:`_resolve_concept_reference` exactly as a relationship end does. A collection's
        identity is checked with the same :meth:`SkosGraph.identify` a concept or the vocabulary
        itself uses (D3): a blank-node collection is fatal, collected, and the run continues (FR-003).
        The structural exception is ``skos:memberList`` itself — an RDF list, made of blank nodes by
        construction (research.md R2) — read through ``graph.items()``, which yields the member
        *URIs*, never the list's own cells, so those blank nodes never reach ``identify``. A URI
        matching an existing collection already in a different vocabulary is left untouched, set
        aside naming both (review fix 9, D42); a URI matching no collection but already held by a
        :class:`Concept` is set aside rather than made to identify two records at once (fix 10, D43).

        ``skos:member`` (unordered) or ``skos:memberList`` (ordered, in file order) name the desired
        membership. An ordered collection with no ``memberList`` falls back to ``member``, sorted;
        when both are present, ``memberList`` governs order and any ``member`` it omits is appended
        after, sorted (review fix 11, D44 — ``memberList`` narrows ``member`` rather than replacing
        it). Each member URI is resolved through :meth:`_resolve_concept_reference`; one that
        resolves to nothing is set aside (:data:`SetAsideReason.MISSING_MEMBER`) rather than failing
        the run (FR-011), and the collection is still created holding whatever did resolve.

        Membership is written only through the model's own API (``Collection.add``/``remove``/
        ``set_member_order``), never a :class:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.CollectionMember` row
        constructed directly, so the model's cross-scheme check always runs. An existing membership
        is only ever a *removal* candidate when its member belongs to ``successful_concepts`` (D30,
        the same rule relationship reconciliation follows, applied to a second model).

        Finally (T034, FR-013), every existing collection of the target vocabulary never seen among
        ``collection_nodes`` is left completely untouched and named in ``report.absent_from_source``.
