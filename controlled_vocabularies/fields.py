"""``ConceptField`` and ``ConceptsField`` — attach concepts to a consuming model.

A ``ForeignKey`` subclass and a ``ManyToManyField`` subclass a consuming project
declares on its own model, each naming its vocabularies by slug. Both fix the
kwargs the consumer does not supply — ``to="controlled_vocabularies.Concept"``,
``on_delete=PROTECT``, and ``limit_choices_to`` restricted to the named
vocabularies — so almost everything FR-002/FR-005/FR-006/FR-007 ask for falls
out of ``limit_choices_to``: it is what ``ForeignKey.validate()`` applies, and
it is a ``Q``, so it is lazy and never queries the database while the
declaration is only being read (FR-003).

Both take the same ``vocabulary`` argument, in the same three shapes, and mean
the same thing by each (#111): one slug, several, or none at all. A declaration
naming none gives up the restriction and keeps every other guarantee.

    :class:`ConceptsField` takes, through the
    :class:`ConceptFieldMixin` contract both fields inherit: a single
    :class:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.ConceptScheme` slug, a list of
    slugs, or omitted entirely. A declaration naming no vocabulary is a
    supported shape rather than an error — it keeps the delete protection and
    the label/URI readback, and gives up only the restriction. ``to``,
    ``on_delete`` and ``limit_choices_to`` are not the consumer's to supply:
    ``on_delete`` is refused outright (FR-007's guarantee is not theirs to

    from ``vocabulary``, set only when the declaration named at least one (an
    empty restriction is not set at all, rather than a restriction that matches
    everything by accident).

    ``to`` is always the *string* ``"controlled_vocabularies.Concept"``, never
    the imported class — deliberately, not a detail. Migration state rejects a
    resolved model class in a field's ``to``: ``ModelState`` has to be
    rebuildable without every referenced model already loaded, and raises
    ``ValueError`` the moment one holds a live class rather than a string. An
    ordinary ``ForeignKey`` never hits this, because its own ``deconstruct()``
    stringifies a live-class ``to`` before anything rebuilds from it — but
    this field's :meth:`deconstruct` strips ``to`` from the emitted kwargs
    entirely (T003), so ``__init__`` is the only place the string can come
    from. The consequence is real: with a string ``to``,
    ``remote_field.model`` only resolves once the field is attached to a
    model class (``RelatedField.contribute_to_class()`` defers to
    ``lazy_related_operation``), so an *unbound* field cannot run
    ``validate()`` — that assertion belongs to a task with a real consuming

    through model (FR-005, D2, R1, R3, R6, T012): refuse the whole write when
    any incoming concept falls outside ``field``'s resolved restriction — of
    which the vocabulary-only case (no ``collection``/``concepts``/``branch``
    named) is one, not a separate check.

    Connected only against a field whose declaration named at least one
    vocabulary (:meth:`ConceptsField.contribute_to_class`) — a field naming
    none has nothing to enforce, and this receiver is never bound to its
    through model in that case.

    Bound with the field itself (T012), not with ``vocabulary`` alone: both
    branches below read ``field.get_limit_choices_to()``, so this and every
    other enforcement path (research.md R1) resolve the same restriction and
    cannot drift apart the way ``ConceptField`` and ``ConceptsField``
    themselves once did (#111).

    Only ``pre_add`` is checked. ``post_add``, ``pre_remove``, ``post_remove``,
    ``pre_clear`` and ``post_clear`` all reach this same receiver and are
    ignored.

    Both directions are checked, but they are not the same check. Django
    gives every relation a live reverse accessor unless the declaration hides
    it, so ``concept.deposit_set.add(a_deposit)`` reaches the same through
    model as ``deposit.rock_types.add(a_concept)`` and has to be refused on
    the same terms. What differs is where the concept is: on a forward write
    ``pk_set`` holds the incoming concepts' primary keys, so ``model``
    (``Concept``) is queried directly; on a reverse write ``pk_set`` holds the
    *owner* model's keys instead, and the single concept being attached is
    ``instance`` (D16) — so its own admission is checked with ``type(instance)``,
    never with ``model``, which is the *owner*'s class on that branch.

    Raising here aborts the whole write before any row is inserted (FR-005).
    ``QuerySet.set()`` is implemented as ``remove()`` then ``add()``, so the
    same receiver refuses a mixed write whole, leaving the record's existing
    set untouched (D2).

    R2, R5), once per class.

    ``full_clean()``'s own ``clean_fields()`` walks ``_meta.fields``, which
    excludes ``ManyToManyField`` by an explicit filter (R2), so a required
    :class:`ConceptsField` has no hook into model validation without this.

    The wrapper resolves the required ``ConceptsField``s from
    ``type(self)._meta.get_fields()`` *at call time* rather than closing
    over the field instance that triggered this install — the install runs
    once per class, so a wrapper bound to one field would leave a second
    required ``ConceptsField`` on the same class silently unenforced, with
    nothing raising and no test failing.

    That call-time resolution is also why the guard tests the resolved
    ``full_clean`` itself rather than a flag on the class. A subclass
    inherits a wrapper that already enumerates ``type(self)``'s fields, so
    it needs no wrapper of its own, and installing a second one around the
    first would report every empty required field twice on a multi-table
    child. A subclass that overrides ``full_clean`` itself gets an untagged
    method and is wrapped normally.

    An unsaved record (``pk`` is ``None``) is skipped outright: touching a
    many-to-many manager before the instance has a primary key raises
    ``ValueError``, which ``full_clean`` does not catch, and a record's
    memberships cannot exist before the record does (D3). The wrapped
    ``full_clean``'s own errors survive — this only adds to the error
    dictionary it raises, under each empty required field's own name, and
    re-raises the merged whole.

    A *saved* record is skipped too, but only for the call
    ``ModelForm._post_clean()`` makes (#124). That call happens before
    ``save_m2m()`` attaches anything a submission carries, so this check
    would otherwise read the relation exactly as it stood before the
    submission — refusing the one write that would have populated it, on an
    existing record whose relation happens to still be empty. Django's own
    ``forms/models.py`` has exactly one caller of ``Model.full_clean()``
    (``BaseModelForm._post_clean``, confirmed against the installed wheel),
    and it is the only caller that passes ``validate_unique=False`` — every
    other path, direct or otherwise, takes that parameter's default of
    ``True``. That makes it the one signal available to tell a ModelForm's
    own call apart from a direct one without threading form state through
    ``full_clean``'s call chain. It is safe to key off: the required half of
    FR-010's "by any form built from the model" clause is already carried by
    ``ManyToManyField.formfield()``'s own ``required=not blank``, which
    Django's ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` checks against the *submitted*
    data rather than the instance, so it is unaffected by where ``save_m2m``
    falls in the lifecycle. A direct ``full_clean()`` call — the other half
    of FR-010 — keeps ``validate_unique`` at its default and stays checked.

        ``ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`` generates and registers its
        own through model inside its own body, after its ``super()`` call and
        before returning — there is no seam an ordinary ``super()`` call
        leaves open to substitute a different one. Calling it and then
        generating a second model of the same name registers that name twice,
        and Django's app registry warns ``Model … was already registered`` on
        every consuming declaration. The way through is entering the MRO one
        class higher,
        ``super(ManyToManyField, self).contribute_to_class(cls, name,
        **kwargs)``, which attaches the field without generating anything.

        That skip drops ``ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class``'s own hidden
        ``related_name`` rewrite (the branch that keeps
        ``related_name="+"`` from clashing between two such fields on one
        model, FR-011), so it is replicated here, before the ``super()``
        call. The symmetrical branch (self-referential relations) is not
        replicated: the target is always ``Concept`` and never the owner, so
        that condition can never hold for this field.

        Once the through model exists, an ``m2m_changed`` receiver is
        connected against it (FR-005, D2, T005) — but only when the
        declaration named at least one vocabulary; a field naming none has
        nothing to enforce, and connecting a receiver that would return
        immediately keeps Django's ``bulk_create`` fast path permanently
        disabled for no guarantee gained (R6). Connecting it here, rather
        than in ``AppConfig.ready()`` or on import of some other module, is
        load-bearing: R6 found that a truthy ``auto_created`` re-enables
        that fast path, which skips ``m2m_changed`` entirely whenever no
        receiver is connected for the through model. Binding the receiver
        at the moment the through model is generated means a declaration
        cannot exist without its own guard. ``weak=False`` because the
        receiver is a fresh ``partial`` with no other reference keeping it
        alive — a weak reference would let it be garbage-collected before
        any write ever reaches it.

        Alongside the through generation, ``get_<name>_labels()`` and
        ``get_<name>_uris()`` are contributed to the consuming model
        (FR-008, FR-009, T008) — plural, named the way ``ConceptField``'s
        own singular ``get_<name>_label()``/``get_<name>_uri()`` are.
        Labels come from each attached concept's
        :meth:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.Concept.display_label`,
        which already resolves the active language with fallback to the
        vocabulary's default; URIs are each concept's ``uri`` unchanged.
        An unsaved instance (``pk`` is ``None``) is guarded explicitly:
        Django's many-to-many manager raises ``ValueError`` the moment its
        queryset is touched before the instance has a primary key, and
        both accessors promise an empty result rather than a raise for a
        record holding nothing. The ``setattr`` is guarded exactly like
        ``ConceptField``'s: a model that already defines either name keeps
        its own definition.
