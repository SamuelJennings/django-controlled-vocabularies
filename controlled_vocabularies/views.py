One route serves both the FK and M2M concept fields, since both target the same
``Concept`` model. The multi-name search and the allowlists that close the
filter/order surface are later tasks. Result shaping is this task's: a result
carries exactly the identifier, the preferred label and the vocabulary a concept
belongs to (FR-005, FR-012) — not the editorial notes or hidden/alternative

        actually calls (``django_tomselect/autocompletes.py:399``,
        ``order_queryset()`` at line 685). The design notes for this story
        name the method ``apply_ordering()``; the installed
        ``django-tomselect`` exposes no method by that name, so an override
        written under it would sit dead and never run. ``order_queryset()``
        is the real seam and reads exactly the way the design intended:
        overridden outright, one condition, one annotation.

        The collection's order applies when, and only when, both hold: the

        collection, an unresolved declaration, a typed query — falls
        through to ``super()`` and the inherited ``("label", "pk")``: a
        typed query wants relevance, not the curator's browsing sequence.

        The position is read through a ``Subquery`` annotation keyed on the
        declaration's own collection and vocabulary slugs, never through a
        ``collection_memberships__`` lookup: a concept may belong to more
        than one collection, and that lookup joins ``CollectionMember`` onto
        a queryset this view reaches with ``complex_filter()`` bare —
