"""Form fields for :mod:`controlled_vocabularies` (T004, FR-001, FR-003, FR-009).

``ConceptFieldMixin.formfield()`` (``fields.py``) returns ``ConceptChoiceField``
for a ``ConceptField`` and ``ConceptsChoiceField`` for a ``ConceptsField``, so an
ordinary ``ModelForm`` built from a consuming model gets the search-as-you-type
control from the model declaration alone — a project never names a widget or
declares a form field (FR-001, plan.md A3).

Both fields' widgets carry the load-bearing part of this task (decisions.md D12,
plan.md A6 path two). The library's own ``TomSelectModelWidget.get_queryset()``
walks back to the autocomplete endpoint through an *ambient* request; during a
form POST that request is the page's own submission, whose ``GET`` carries no
``field=`` reference, so the endpoint's fail-closed refusal (a missing/invalid
reference) would be the guaranteed state on every submission and
``ModelChoiceField.to_python()`` would raise ``invalid_choice`` for a legitimate
concept. This module's widgets override ``get_queryset()`` to build the
restriction directly from the model field instance ``formfield()`` already holds
— ``Concept.objects.complex_filter(field.get_limit_choices_to())`` — with no
request consulted, restoring what an unmodified ``ModelChoiceField`` already does
with ``limit_choices_to``.

    may newly contain; :class:`_ConceptWidgetReferenceMixin` carries only a
    reference for *searching*). What a record already holds is displayed
    unrestricted; this mixin is where that happens, and it touches neither of
    the other two.

    ``_get_selected_options()`` (``widgets.py:959``) is where the library
    resolves an already-attached value into what the control renders as
    selected, and it does so through ``self.get_queryset()`` —
    :class:`_ConceptWidgetValidationMixin`'s narrowed queryset (D12) — so
    without this override an attached concept whose vocabulary the field no
    longer names would be silently dropped from the render, and the absence
    saved back on the next submission (R1). The swap is scoped to this one
    call: ``get_queryset`` is shadowed on the instance only for the duration
    of the library's own ``_get_selected_options()`` and the shadow is deleted
    in a ``finally``, leaving the instance exactly as it was found, so nothing
    else that reads ``self.get_queryset()`` — including validation — ever
    observes the unrestricted queryset.

    ``get_label_for_object()`` (``widgets.py:1039``) is the other property
    A8 calls out ("labels must come out as ``display_label()`` ... rather
    than ``str(obj)``"). With ``label_field="display_label"``
    (:func:`_config`), the library reads it straight off the model instance
    with ``getattr(obj, "display_label")`` — and
    :meth:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.Concept.display_label` is a
    method, not a property, so unmodified this stringifies the *bound
    method* rather than calling it. Confirmed against the installed wheel
    (``2026.6.2``) with a real ``Concept`` instance: the rendered label came
    out as ``"<bound method Concept.display_label of ...>"``, not a label.
    T003's AJAX search path (``prepare_results()``) never hits this — it
    builds a plain dict with ``"display_label"`` already a string — so this
    only ever affects the already-selected render this mixin owns, and only

    ``options.py:215`` — back to the widget it holds, and stores every other
    value unchanged. No Django code is patched: the wrap still happens, this
    field just declines to keep it, the same way any attribute assignment can
    be declined by owning a property for it.

    Must come **before** the django-tomselect field class in a subclass's
    bases. Django's ``ChoiceField`` sets ``widget`` as a plain class
    attribute (``forms/fields.py``), and a plain attribute earlier in the MRO
    than this property would shadow it — attribute lookup stops at the first
    class in the MRO that defines the name, and only a data descriptor found
    first wins over one found later.

    The getter tolerates being read before anything has been stored:
    ``django/forms/fields.py:146`` evaluates ``widget = widget or self.widget``
    during ``Field.__init__``, before any assignment on a freshly constructed
    instance is guaranteed to have run.

    Each field subclass carries ``# type: ignore[misc]``: adding this mixin as
    a second explicit base makes mypy validate the full inherited MRO, which

    ``BaseTomSelectModelMixin`` and Django's ``ModelChoiceField`` over
