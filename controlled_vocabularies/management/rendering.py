(T015, T016, T017, T018, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, plan.md "Rendering").

The bucket counts an import run leaves behind — created, updated, set aside, normalized, absent
from source — plus the set-aside account in full: grouped by reason with a count each, the
per-language account, records absent from the source named in their own section, and per-entry
detail at raised verbosity (``--verbosity``, decisions.md D6). Every section prints, whatever it
holds: a section reading zero and a section silently missing look identical to a reader but mean
different things (FR-008's own reasoning for ``absent_from_source``, applied here to every bucket)
— which is also why each grouping below is a plain iteration over the report's own accessors: an
empty grouping simply yields nothing, and the bucket count above it already shows the zero.
