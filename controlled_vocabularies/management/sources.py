# mistake (craft-security "always/ask/never" — DoS via an unbounded transfer). Both are set
# against real published vocabularies rather than the test fixtures: a large vocabulary is
# often generated per request, so first-byte latency of several seconds is ordinary, and the
# widely-vendored thesauri run to tens of megabytes in RDF/XML. The values catch a server that

# _TIMEOUT_SECONDS is a per-socket-read timeout and _MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES counts bytes, so a

# timeout forever and never approaches the ceiling. Measured on the branch before this: a
# stub trickling one byte per 20s was still being read after 65 seconds having transferred
# 3 bytes, and would never have stopped. Generous against the same real vocabularies the

# An opener carrying only the http/https handlers (T008, research.md R3): a handler
# removed, not a check added. Python's default opener's HTTPRedirectHandler permits a
# redirect onto ftp as well as http/https, and checking the final URL on the response
# object happens only after urllib has already connected and pulled the body — this
# opener has no handler for any other scheme, so it fails before a connection is attempted.
#
# Built via OpenerDirector().add_handler(...) rather than build_opener(...): build_opener
# always merges its own default handlers (FTPHandler, FileHandler, DataHandler, ...) for
# every protocol not explicitly overridden by an instance of the *same* default class, so
# build_opener(HTTPHandler, HTTPSHandler, HTTPRedirectHandler, HTTPErrorProcessor) still
# carries a live FTPHandler — confirmed by inspecting opener.handlers and by a redirect to
# ftp://10.255.255.1/... actually reaching ftplib's connect and timing out on it, which is
# the real network call this design exists to prevent (decisions.md D15). UnknownHandler is
# added so a scheme with no registered handler raises URLError immediately rather than
# OpenerDirector.open() silently returning None. HTTPDefaultErrorHandler is added for the
# same reason: without it, HTTPErrorProcessor's own non-2xx handling has nothing registered
# to call and OpenerDirector.open() returns None for a 404/500 instead of raising HTTPError
# (found by this task's own failing test, T010).
