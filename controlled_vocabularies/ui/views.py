    T006, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-018).

    One row per SKOS statement the concept makes about itself, in the order plan.md Key
    design decision #4 fixes: type, preferred label, alternative labels, notes (in the
    order :class:`~controlled_vocabularies.models.ConceptNote.Kind` declares them),
    relations — broader, narrower, related — then the vocabulary holding it. Collection
    membership is never a row here: it is a statement *other* records make about this
    one, not one this concept makes about itself, and sits outside this list entirely
    (decisions.md D4). A hidden label is never read at all (FR-004). A property with no
    value in ``language``, and none in ``default_language`` either, contributes no row,
    so a template built over this needs no emptiness logic of its own.

    ``language`` is the language being read. Whether a value absent in ``language``
    falls back to ``default_language`` (FR-005) is the caller's decision, not this
    function's own (decisions.md D6): passing ``default_language=None``, the default,
    requests no fallback at all — a property absent in ``language`` contributes no row,
    full stop, which is what lets a caller ask what a concept holds in exactly one
    language. Passing the vocabulary's own effective default language opts every
    property into the same per-value fallback :meth:`Concept.display_label` already
    applies to the preferred label alone.

    same five names the ``property_row`` cotton component takes (T002). A record-valued
