"""URL configuration for the opt-in vocabulary-browsing front end (013-find-a-vocabulary T006,
015-read-single-record T000).

``app_name`` is distinct from the core app's own ``controlled_vocabularies`` namespace, so a
project can mount both without either shadowing the other's reverses (plan.md Key design
decisions #4). Views are imported relatively, staying inside this app's own package.
