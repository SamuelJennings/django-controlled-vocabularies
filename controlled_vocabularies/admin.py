"""The one admin-facing lookup this package owns (T006, FR-004, FR-006).

Registers nothing. ``forms.py``'s declining mixin calls
:func:`related_field_widget_wrapper_class` on every ``widget`` assignment, so
this module is imported on every render regardless of whether the admin is
installed — FR-006 is satisfied by the import inside this function staying
conditional, not by keeping this module itself unimported (plan.md,
