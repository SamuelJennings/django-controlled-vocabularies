    Walks every installed model for declared ``ConceptField`` and ``ConceptsField`` instances
    and resolves the distinct vocabulary slugs those fields name in **one** query, rather than
    one per field. Both fields hold ``vocabulary`` as a tuple naming zero, one or several
    (``decisions.md`` D9, #111), so each contributes every slug it names to the flattened
    distinct set rather than one. A field naming no vocabulary (the empty tuple) names nothing
    that could be missing, so it contributes nothing and is never warned about. Where a field
    names several and only one is absent, the warning names that slug rather than the field's
    whole declaration, so a developer reading ``manage.py check`` learns which vocabulary to
    import.

    The check runs before ``migrate`` (``BaseCommand.requires_system_checks`` defaults to
    ``"__all__"``), so on a fresh install it runs against a database with no tables yet. A
    missing table is not evidence that a vocabulary is absent, so that state — surfaced as
    ``ProgrammingError``, ``OperationalError`` or an unreachable database, all subclasses of
    ``DatabaseError`` — yields no warnings rather than raising (FR-003, ``research.md`` R3).
