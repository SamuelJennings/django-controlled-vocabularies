"""The guard's assertion script (T013-T017, FR-017, FR-019, User Story 3 scenarios 1, 3, 5, 9;

Speaks real HTTP against a running demo server. It follows the vocabulary list to one
vocabulary's own page and searches inside it, then follows the authored vocabulary to one of its
own concepts and one of its own collections, because those are the pages this feature ships. It
asserts on the served response, never on the code that produced it, because the failure it
exists to catch is the one every unit test passes through: a template that renders in a test
client and not in a browser.

The assertions themselves (:func:`check_list`, :func:`check_search`, :func:`check_vocabulary_page`,
:func:`check_concept_search`, :func:`check_authored_vocabulary_page`, :func:`check_concept_page`,
:func:`check_concept_page_in_a_second_language`, :func:`check_collection_page`) and the
link-following helper (:func:`extract_vocabulary_url`) are separated from the HTTP transport
(:func:`get`) so they can be exercised against an in-process response too
(``tests/test_demo/test_smoke.py``) — "a broken assertion fails here rather than only in CI".

Not a test module: standard library only, run directly against a live server, not under pytest
(conventions; constitution Article VII).

BODY_EXCERPT_LIMIT = 500

#: The demo's two seeded vocabularies and how many concepts each carries (demo/seed/*.ttl,
#: demo/management/commands/seed_demo.py) — named here once rather than re-derived, since the
#: walk's whole job is to notice when the served page stops agreeing with them.

AUTHORED_NAME = "Data Collection Methods"
AUTHORED_CONCEPT_COUNT = 4

#: A word that appears in the imported vocabulary's own name and nowhere in the authored one's
#: name or description — narrow enough that a search for it proves the search narrowed rather
#: than merely returned something.
SEARCH_TERM = "DCMI"

#: A concept the demo seeds into the imported vocabulary (demo/seed/dcmi_types.ttl, T016),
#: named here to prove the vocabulary's own page lists a concept it actually holds.
VOCABULARY_CONCEPT = "Dataset"

#: Another concept in the same vocabulary — present on the unsearched page, and what a search
#: narrowing correctly must exclude.
OTHER_VOCABULARY_CONCEPT = "Collection"

#: The hidden label seeded onto VOCABULARY_CONCEPT (demo/seed/dcmi_types.ttl, T016): a
#: plausible misspelling of the term itself, never shown on the page, findable only by search
#: (User Story 3 scenario 3).
HIDDEN_LABEL_SEARCH_TERM = "Datset"

#: A concept in the authored vocabulary (demo/seed/research_methods.ttl, 015-read-single-record
#: T024) whose own page the walk follows next — chosen because it carries every one of the
#: things this feature's closing task added to the seed: a stored relation, membership in both
#: seeded collections, and the German-only note that exercises FR-005's language fallback
#: alongside its own English-only definition, on the one page.
AUTHORED_CONCEPT = "Fieldwork"

#: AUTHORED_CONCEPT's own short form (T003, T016: ``{scheme.slug}:{record.slug}``) — a
#: record-valued row (an in-site relation, a collection's member) carries this as its
#: link text, never the plain label AUTHORED_CONCEPT itself names.
AUTHORED_CONCEPT_SHORT_FORM = "data-collection-methods:fieldwork"

#: AUTHORED_CONCEPT's narrower concept (research_methods.ttl: "survey" carries
#: ``skos:broader`` to "fieldwork") — shown on AUTHORED_CONCEPT's own page under
#: ``skos:narrower``, derived rather than separately stated (FR-010), by its own short
#: form rather than its plain label, for the same reason AUTHORED_CONCEPT_SHORT_FORM
#: exists.
AUTHORED_RELATED_CONCEPT_SHORT_FORM = "data-collection-methods:survey"

#: One of the two collections research_methods.ttl already seeded (T020) that gathers
#: AUTHORED_CONCEPT — named on AUTHORED_CONCEPT's own page, below its definition list
#: (FR-014), and the walk's own destination for AUTHORED_CONCEPT's page (FR-013). Named
#: there by its plain ``name`` (concept_detail.html's membership section is not a
#: property_row, so it carries no short form of its own).
AUTHORED_COLLECTION = "Typical project workflow"

#: The German-only note seeded onto AUTHORED_CONCEPT (research_methods.ttl,
#: 015-read-single-record T024): shown when the page is read in German, never in the
#: unseeded reading language the rest of this walk uses (FR-005).
GERMAN_SCOPE_NOTE = "Erhoben durch unmittelbare Beobachtung oder Messung am Studienort."

#: AUTHORED_CONCEPT's English-only definition — carries no German value of its own, so
#: reading the same page in German falls back to this rather than showing nothing
#: (FR-005, the other half of the fallback GERMAN_SCOPE_NOTE's own presence proves).
