"""Django settings for the demo / dev server (T015, FR-014, FR-015, FR-018).

Written out in full rather than imported from the test settings: a reader comparing this
against README.md's "Finding a vocabulary" section should find the same wiring twice, and a
settings module that imports the tests' would teach nobody anything and would drag test-only
choices — an in-memory database, a fixed URI base — into the thing meant to look like a real
project (plan.md Complexity Tracking).
