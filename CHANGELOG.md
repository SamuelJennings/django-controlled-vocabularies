# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Finding a vocabulary: an opt-in `ui` extra (`pip install django-controlled-vocabularies[ui]`)
  adds one page listing every vocabulary the site holds, alphabetically and stably, each entry
  showing its description, its concept count, and whether it was authored here or imported from
  a publisher — with the publisher's own identifier shown for an imported one. A site holding
  none says so, in wording distinct from a search that matches nothing. No entry links to the
  vocabulary it names yet — nothing serves that address on the site until a later feature adds
  it. See the README.

### Fixed

- `ConceptsField`: a required field on an existing record no longer refuses a valid submission
  through a `ModelForm` when the relation is still empty. The required-set check installed on
  `full_clean()` ran before `ModelForm._post_clean()`'s own `save_m2m()` attached anything a
  submission carried, so it read the relation exactly as it stood before the submission — the one
  path that would have populated it. The form field's own `required` flag already validates the
  submitted data correctly; the model-level check now defers to it during a `ModelForm`'s own
  clean and still applies in full to a direct `full_clean()` call. (#124)

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Choosing a concept by typing: `ConceptField` and `ConceptsField` now render, by default and in
  any Django form built from a consuming model, as a search-as-you-type control backed by this
  package's own search endpoint (`controlled_vocabularies.urls`). A project wires it in three
  steps — include the route, add `django_tomselect` to `INSTALLED_APPS`, and add
  `django_tomselect.middleware.TomSelectMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE` — each reported by
  `manage.py check` when missing (`controlled_vocabularies.W002`, `W003`, `W004`). A search
  returns a concept's identifier, its preferred label in the active language, and its
  vocabulary's name, restricted to whatever vocabularies the field declares and carrying no
  permission rule of its own; a project needing to restrict which concepts are searchable
  restricts the include instead. Matching runs case-insensitively across a concept's preferred,
  alternative and hidden labels in the active language and its default-language preferred label,
  a concept matching on several appearing once. Pages are bounded and stable: a page past the
  last returns nothing rather than re-serving the first. An already-attached concept still
  renders, under its active-language preferred label, even when its vocabulary is no longer named
  by the field's declaration. The control needs a browser running JavaScript; without one, both
  fields still work as an ordinary required-relation form field. See the README.
- Choosing a concept in the admin: the same search-as-you-type control now renders on a consuming
  model's Django admin pages once it's registered, with nothing further to configure — the wiring
  is the three steps above and the admin adds nothing to them. A concept is chosen there, never
  created or edited: no add, change, delete or view affordance for the related concept, whatever
  permissions the signed-in person holds. Where the admin presents the field read-only, the concept
  is shown by its preferred label and no control renders, Django's own read-only presentation.
  `autocomplete_fields`, `raw_id_fields`, a form's own declared widget, and `readonly_fields` each
  still work as they would for any other related field. The first three render what they asked for
  and keep the same no-affordance and validation guarantees as the default control. See the README.
- New runtime dependency: [`django-tomselect`](https://pypi.org/project/django-tomselect/)
  `^2026.6.2`, which the concept search control above is built on.
- `ConceptsField`: a `ManyToManyField` field a consuming project declares on its own model, naming
  zero, one, or several vocabularies by their `ConceptScheme` slugs. Naming one or several
  restricts form choices and the write path to those vocabularies, refusing a concept from any
  other and naming every accepted vocabulary in the refusal; naming none restricts nothing, for a
  plain keywords-style field. Every shape refuses deletion of a referenced concept
  (`on_delete=PROTECT` on the generated through model) whether the delete reaches it directly, via
  a bulk queryset delete, or cascades down from its scheme — for anything going through the ORM,
  since Django writes no `ON DELETE` clause into the schema for any relation. `blank=True` makes
  the field optional; without it, `full_clean()` refuses a record holding zero concepts, because
  Django's own field validation has no hook for a many-to-many field. Adds
  `get_<field>_labels()` / `get_<field>_uris()` accessors reading every attached concept's
  preferred label (falling back to the vocabulary's default language) and URI, returning an empty
  list rather than raising for a record holding nothing, without overwriting either name on a
  model that already defines it. See the README.
- `ConceptField`: a `ForeignKey` field a consuming project declares on its own model, naming zero,
  one, or several vocabularies by their `ConceptScheme` slugs. It takes the same three shapes
  `ConceptsField` takes and means the same thing by each. Naming one or several constrains form
  choices and `full_clean()` to those vocabularies and refuses a concept from any other, naming
  every accepted vocabulary in the refusal. Naming none restricts nothing. Every shape refuses
  deletion of a referenced concept (`on_delete=PROTECT`) whether the delete
  reaches it directly or cascades down from its scheme, and adds `get_<field>_label()` /
  `get_<field>_uri()` accessors reading the attached concept's preferred label (falling back to
  the vocabulary's default language) and URI, without overwriting either name on a model that
  already defines it. A named vocabulary that has not been imported yet does not stop the field
  from being declared or the app from starting. Instead, `manage.py check` reports a warning
  (`controlled_vocabularies.W001`) naming the model, field, and missing slug. See the README.
- Importing a published SKOS vocabulary: `import_skos(file, *, serialization=None, scheme=None)`
  reads a Turtle, RDF/XML, or JSON-LD file and creates or updates the vocabulary it declares, its
  concepts, their labels and documentary notes, their broader/narrower and related relationships,
  and their collection membership, every record matched by its static URI. Re-running an import
  upserts rather than deleting and recreating: a record the file still contains has its content
  matched to the file exactly, including removing a value the file no longer carries, while a
  record the file does not mention at all is left untouched and named in the report instead of
  being deleted. Returns an `ImportReport` — a plain dataclass, not rendered text — with `created`,
  `updated`, `set_aside` (a translatable, closed-vocabulary reason per value the app could not
  store, e.g. an unconfigured language, a notation, a mapping to another vocabulary, or a predicate
  the models have no place for), `absent_from_source`, `normalized` (a value stored under a
  different predicate than the file asserted, e.g. a foreign `dcterms:description` read as a
  concept's definition), and `fatal` buckets; a run either succeeds in full or writes nothing,
  raising `SkosImportFailed` (carrying the same report) on a fatal problem such as a missing or
  blank-node identity. `SkosImportError` covers every other reason a file could not be turned into
  usable SKOS at all (not found, unsupported serialization, unparseable, or refused by the safety
  scan). Code catching only `(SkosImportError, SkosImportFailed)` already catches everything else
  this function can raise. Reading a file never reassigns identity: a concept or collection
  whose URI is already held by a different vocabulary, or by a record of another kind, is set aside
  and reported rather than moved or duplicated. Imported files are treated as untrusted input.
  RDF/XML is scanned for unsafe constructs (entity expansion, external references) before it is
  parsed, and a JSON-LD document is refused rather than fetched if its `@context` names a remote
  location, whether a plain string reference or an `@import` reference inside an inline object
  context, at any nesting depth an array context reaches. Reading a file never makes a network
  request. Both refusals raise an exported, translatable
  `UnsafeRdfXmlError`/`UnsafeJsonLdError`, each a `SkosImportError` subclass. A management
  command wraps this for command-line use (see below). No web-facing entry point yet.
  See the README.
- A management command, `import_skos`, runs the same import from a terminal:
  `python manage.py import_skos <source> [--format FORMAT] [--dry-run]`. The source can be a
  local path or an `http://`/`https://` URL, fetched under a fixed read timeout, byte ceiling and
  transfer deadline, and read with its identifiers resolved against the address it was served from
  after any redirect, so a vocabulary published behind a PURL or a `/latest` alias is stored under
  its publisher's own URIs and a re-import updates the same concepts the first import created.
  `--format` names the source's serialization for one whose extension or `Content-Type` does not.
  `--dry-run` performs the entire import and reports the outcome exactly as a live run would,
  then rolls the database back to its state beforehand.
  Output is bucket counts by default — created, updated, set aside, normalized, and absent from
  source, plus the set-aside account grouped by reason and by language — with every individual
  set-aside entry added at `--verbosity 2` or above, and nothing at all at `--verbosity 0`.
  The command exits non-zero only on a refusal.
  A run that sets values aside — which importing a vocabulary published in more languages than a
  site configures for always does — exits zero.
- Importing now matches a published language tag by base language rather than by exact string
  equality. A file's `en` value fills a site configured for `en-gb`, and a file's `en-gb` value
  fills a site configured for `en`, matched case-insensitively in both directions, with an exact
  tag match always winning over a variant. A value stored under a variant match is reported as a
  substitution, which is distinct from a value set aside outright.
- Where a preferred label has several variants of one configured language and no exact match, the
  vocabulary's predominant variant is stored and ties are broken by language code. Each losing
  variant is set aside and reported under its own published language. Alternative labels, hidden
  labels, and notes have no such limit, so every variant offered is stored.
- `ImportReport` gains `language_account()`, a per-published-language count of everything left
  behind for a language reason. It is present and empty after a run that left nothing behind, so a
  caller can see what configuring a language would recover.
- The site's configured languages are still read from `settings.LANGUAGES`. A project that declares
  none inherits Django's 99-language default, so narrowing that list is how a site narrows what an
  import stores.
- Static, externally assigned identifiers: `ConceptScheme`, `Concept`, and `Collection` each gain a
  `static_uri` field holding an identifier assigned by an external publisher, held exactly as given
  and never recomputed by the app. Nothing in the package overwrites a stored value, and nothing
  stops you from editing one either, so make the field non-editable wherever you expose it once a
  record is published. A locally authored, unpublished record's `uri` instead stays dynamic,
  composed and reported live and following a rename, until one is assigned. `local_url` is a new,
  separate accessor for this site's own address for a record, always composed from the configured
  base address and the record's slugs regardless of what `static_uri` holds. `has_static_uri`
  reports whether the identifier is static rather than dynamic.
  `get_by_uri()` — already on `Concept.objects` — is now shared by `ConceptScheme.objects` and
  `Collection.objects` too, resolving a stored identifier first and falling back to the site's own
  composition. `validate_static_uri` is exported for reuse: it requires an absolute identifier with
  an accepted scheme and caps length at 500 characters.
- An imported concept's slug, and a vocabulary's own, is now derived from its own published
  identifier rather than from a translated label — the identifier's fragment where it has one,
  otherwise the last segment of its path. Assigned once, on first import, and never recomputed by a
  later one, so a publisher renaming a record, or a vocabulary's name arriving in a different
  language, no longer moves that record's local address. A record authored on this site rather than
  imported is unaffected and keeps deriving its slug from its label. The cost: a vocabulary
  published under opaque codes now gets an opaque local address.
- `CONTROLLED_VOCABULARIES_ALLOWED_URI_SCHEMES` setting: the schemes an externally assigned
  `static_uri` may use — `http`, `https`, `urn`, `doi`, `info`, `ark`, `tag`, `hdl`, and `oai` by
  default (see the README).
- Collections: a vocabulary's concepts can be gathered into named collections, optionally ordered,
  held on the new `Collection` and `CollectionMember` models and reached through `Collection.add()`,
  `remove()`, `members()`, `set_member_order()`, and `Concept.collections()`. Membership is
  many-to-many, held once per collection, and confined to the collection's own vocabulary. It asserts
  no relation between members, so a collection stays clear of the broader/narrower hierarchy. An
  ordered collection reads its members back in a deliberate sequence. Authored through the ORM. The
  editing interface comes later.

- Concept relationships: concepts within a vocabulary can be linked through a broader/narrower
  hierarchy and a symmetric related association, held on the new `ConceptRelation` model and reached
  through `Concept.broader()`, `narrower()`, `related()`, and the `add_`/`remove_` helpers. Only the
  broader direction is stored; narrower is derived, so the pair can never disagree. A concept may sit
  under several broader concepts. The model refuses a self-relation, a duplicate, a broader/related
  overlap on the same pair, and a link across vocabularies; a cycle in the hierarchy is not prevented
  (a deliberate non-guarantee for now). Authored through the ORM; the editing interface comes later.
- Multilingual concepts: each concept carries per-language labels (one preferred label per language,
  plus any number of alternative and hidden labels) and the full SKOS documentary note family:
  `definition`, `scopeNote`, `example`, `editorialNote`, `historyNote`, `changeNote`, and a generic
  note. All are language-tagged and held on the new `ConceptLabel` and `ConceptNote` models. Authored
  through the ORM. The editing interface comes later.
- Per-vocabulary default language: a `ConceptScheme` defaults to the app's `LANGUAGE_CODE` but can
  set its own default language, which is the one that anchors its concepts' slugs. A German
  vocabulary anchors its identifiers in German inside an English-default app.
- Overridable concept slugs: a slug still derives from the default-language preferred label, but a
  curator can set an explicit slug that survives later relabels.
- `multilingual` factory trait building a fully populated multi-language concept for downstream tests.
- `ConceptScheme` and `Concept` models: a vocabulary is a named container of concepts, each concept
  a term within it. Slugs derive from the scheme name and the concept label and track them while a
  vocabulary is unpublished.
- Stable concept identity: a locally authored concept's URI composes from
  `CONTROLLED_VOCABULARIES_BASE_URI`, the scheme slug, and the concept slug, and stays resolvable when
  a label is reworded. (An externally assigned identifier instead holds verbatim — see static,
  externally assigned identifiers, above.) `Concept.objects.get_by_uri()` resolves a URI back to its
  concept.
- `CONTROLLED_VOCABULARIES_BASE_URI` setting for the URI base address (see the README).
- Test factories (`ConceptSchemeFactory`, `ConceptFactory`) for use in downstream tests.
- Initial project scaffold: package metadata, CI, and early design notes (see `docs/brainstorm.md`).
