# Tasks: Find a vocabulary

**Feature**: `013-find-a-vocabulary` · **Spec**: [`spec.md`](./spec.md) · **Plan**: [`plan.md`](./plan.md)

Every task is test-first per Article I: the test is written and seen to fail before the production
change that makes it pass. Test scope per task is one class or one file; the full suite runs once per
story, at the story's report.

`[P]` marks tasks that could run in parallel with their siblings. Phase 1 is sequential and blocks
everything.

## Phase 1 — Foundational

### T001 — The ui extra exists and CI installs it

**Files**: `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

Declare `django-mvp` as an **optional** dependency pinned `>=0.19,<1.0` with a
`python = ">=3.12"` marker, and add a `[tool.poetry.extras] ui = ["django-mvp"]` entry. django-mvp's
own floor is 3.12 while this package's is 3.11, so the marker makes the extra unavailable there
rather than an error. Add `[tool.deptry.package_module_name_map] django-mvp = "mvp"` — without it
deptry looks for a module named `django_mvp` and reports every ui import as missing. Regenerate the
lock. Change the tests workflow's `poetry-install-args` from `''` to `'--extras ui'`, and add
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/**` to nothing — the workflow's push path filter already covers
`controlled_vocabularies/**`.

Also declare the four test modules that mirror no source module, or the conformance check reads them
as Article XIV violations once T004 and T009 land:

```toml
[tool.forge.conformance]
non-mirror-paths = [
    "tests/test_ui/test_architecture.py",
    "tests/test_ui/test_boot.py",
    "tests/test_ui/test_packaging.py",
    "tests/test_ui/test_templates.py",
]
```

Name the four files, not the `tests/test_ui/` prefix — the rest of that directory does mirror
modules and must stay checked.

**Proves**: nothing on its own. **Verify**: `poetry install --extras ui` succeeds, `poetry check`
clean, `deptry` clean, the existing suite green.

**Depends on**: nothing.

---

### T002 — The ui app exists and registers

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/__init__.py`, `controlled_vocabularies/ui/apps.py`,
`tests/test_ui/__init__.py`, `tests/test_ui/test_apps.py`

`__init__.py` is a module docstring and nothing else — it is imported in the app registry's first
phase, so a re-export reaching `views.py` would touch models and raise `AppRegistryNotReady` at
`django.setup()`. `apps.py` declares the config with `name = "controlled_vocabularies.ui"` and
`label = "controlled_vocabularies_ui"`; the label must differ from the core app's or the registry
refuses both.

Test, in `TestUIAppConfig`: the app registers alongside the core app without raising (a subprocess
with an inline `settings.configure`, per the repo's existing out-of-process precedent in
`tests/settings_no_admin.py`), the config's label is the distinct one, and `__init__.py` parses to
exactly one statement whose value is a string constant.

**Proves**: the app loads and stays inert at import time. **Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_apps.py`.

**Depends on**: T001.

---

### T003 — The test project can render the ui, and can still boot without it

**Files**: `tests/settings.py`, `tests/settings_core.py` (new), `tests/urls.py`,
`tests/urls_core.py` (new)

`tests/settings_core.py` holds what the package needs on its own — the current contents of
`tests/settings.py`, with `ROOT_URLCONF = "tests.urls_core"` pointing at an empty urlconf.
`tests/settings.py` becomes a star-import of it plus the ui stack: `django_cotton`, `easy_icons`,
`flex_menu`, `crispy_forms`, `crispy_tailwind`, `mvp` and `controlled_vocabularies.ui` in
`INSTALLED_APPS`, django-mvp's context processor appended to `TEMPLATES`, and the
`CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK`, `CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS`, `EASY_ICONS` and `FLEX_MENUS` settings
django-mvp expects.
`django-literature`'s `tests/settings.py` is the working list — copy it, do not invent it, but
**filter the copy to django-mvp's own declared dependencies**. In particular it installs
`django_tables2`, which django-mvp does not depend on (it is a guarded optional integration there)
and `--extras ui` does not install; this page is a card grid, not a table, and because
`tests/settings.py` is the settings module for the whole repo, naming an uninstalled app there
fails collection of every test in the suite, not only these. `SITE_ID` goes the same way —
django-mvp uses no `django.contrib.sites`, so the setting is inert.
`tests/urls.py` mounts `controlled_vocabularies.ui.urls` under a non-empty prefix of the test
project's choosing, so a hard-coded path in a view is caught rather than accidentally matching.

**Proves**: nothing on its own. **Verify**: existing suite green under the widened settings;
`manage.py check` clean under both settings modules.

**Depends on**: T002.

---

### T004 — The core neither imports nor requires the ui stack

**Files**: `tests/test_ui/test_architecture.py` (new), `tests/test_ui/test_boot.py` (new),
`tests/test_ui/test_packaging.py` (new)

Three independent proofs, each of which fails for a different mistake:

- **Architecture**: parse every `controlled_vocabularies/**/*.py` outside `ui/` with `ast` and
  assert none imports `mvp`, `django_cotton`, `crispy_forms`, `easy_icons`, `flex_menu` or
  `controlled_vocabularies.ui`. Parsed, not grepped, so a mention in a docstring cannot fail it.
- **Boot**: in a fresh subprocess forcing `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tests.settings_core` inside the
  script (pytest-django exports the other one), run `django.setup()` and `call_command("check")`,
  import every core module, then assert `"controlled_vocabularies.ui" not in sys.modules`.
- **Packaging**: parse `pyproject.toml` with `tomllib` and assert django-mvp is optional, is listed
  in the `ui` extra, and appears in no other extra and no dependency group.

**Proves**: the isolation the whole structure rests on is a property, not a convention.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_architecture.py tests/test_ui/test_boot.py tests/test_ui/test_packaging.py`.

**Depends on**: T003.

---

### T005 — A project that forgets the extra is told so

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/checks.py` (new), `controlled_vocabularies/ui/apps.py`,
`tests/test_ui/test_checks.py` (new)

Register a system check from the ui config's `ready()` that reports an error when `mvp` cannot be
imported, naming both the extra to install and the app that requires it. Without it the first
symptom is `ModuleNotFoundError: mvp` raised from URL loading, which names neither.

Test: with `mvp` importable the check returns nothing; with the import made to fail, it returns one
error carrying the package extra in its message and a stable id.

**Proves**: FR-012's neighbour — the app fails legibly when its dependency is absent.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_checks.py`.

**Depends on**: T002.

---

## Phase 2 — US-1: See every vocabulary the site holds (P1, #143)

### T006 — The page exists at a name, and lists every vocabulary once

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/urls.py` (new), `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py` (new),
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list.html` (new),
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list_item.html` (new),
`tests/test_ui/test_urls.py` (new), `tests/test_ui/test_views.py` (new)

`urls.py` declares `app_name = "controlled_vocabularies_ui"` — distinct from the core's namespace so
both can be mounted in one project — and one route at the empty path named `vocabulary-list`,
importing views relatively. `views.py` holds `VocabularyListView(MVPListView)` over `ConceptScheme`
with `list_item_template` naming the row partial and `template_name` naming the page template. The
page template extends django-mvp's `list_view.html` and, for now, overrides `{% block page.actions %}`
to render nothing — the default block renders search, sort, filter and create, none of which this
story has. The row partial renders the vocabulary's name and description.

Test, in `TestVocabularyList`: reverse the route by name (never by path) and request it; every
vocabulary in the database appears exactly once; a vocabulary added afterwards appears on the next
request; the page renders no sort, filter or create control.

**Proves**: FR-001, FR-012, and the first acceptance scenario of User Story 1.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_urls.py tests/test_ui/test_views.py`.

**Depends on**: T005.

---

### T007 — An entry shows its description, its size, and where it came from

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py`,
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list_item.html`,
`tests/test_ui/test_views.py`

`get_queryset()` annotates `concept_count=Count("concepts")`. The row renders the description, the
count, and the origin: a vocabulary whose `static_uri` is set is shown as imported and shows that
identifier as **text**, never as a link — an identifier is not always a resolvable address; one with
no `static_uri` is shown as held here and shows no identifier.

Test, in `TestVocabularyListEntry`: an imported vocabulary's entry carries its publisher identifier
and the imported wording; a locally authored one carries neither; a vocabulary with three concepts
reports three; one with none still appears and reports none rather than an empty space; a
vocabulary with no description renders without a stray label or punctuation.

**Proves**: FR-002, FR-003, and User Story 1 scenarios 2 to 5.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py -k Entry`.

**Depends on**: T006.

---

### T008 — The order is alphabetical, stable, and costs a flat number of queries

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py`, `tests/test_ui/test_views.py`

Set `ordering = [Lower("name"), "pk"]` as a **class attribute**, not an `.order_by()` call inside
`get_queryset()`. Django applies `self.ordering` innermost, ahead of both django-mvp mixins; ordering
from our own `get_queryset()` would land after the search mixin's `.distinct()`, which is the operand
order upstream's docstring says its mixin order exists to avoid, and this repo's SQLite-only suite
could not catch the consequence. The `Count("concepts")` annotation stays in `get_queryset()`.

The `pk` tiebreaker is not decoration: an order without a total order lets a row appear on two pages
or on neither once pagination is in play. Page size is django-mvp's inherited default — do not
restate it.

Test, in `TestVocabularyListOrdering`: vocabularies whose names differ only in case sort as a reader
would expect and not as byte order would; two requests return the same sequence; two vocabularies
sharing a name still produce a deterministic order; and `django_assert_num_queries` shows the same
query count for a page of three vocabularies as for a page of thirty — which is SC-005 as a test
rather than a claim.

**Proves**: FR-004, SC-005, User Story 1 scenario 6.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py -k Ordering`.

**Depends on**: T007.

---

### T009 — An empty site says so, and nothing links anywhere

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py`,
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list_item.html`,
`tests/test_ui/test_views.py`, `tests/test_ui/test_templates.py` (new)

Override `get_empty_state_heading()` and `get_empty_state_message()` to say the site holds no
vocabularies. Both strings are translatable, as is every string in the templates.

Test: a database with no vocabularies returns 200 and the empty wording. In `test_templates.py`,
read the row partial's source and assert it contains no `{% url %}` tag and no `local_url`
reference, and assert the rendered page contains no anchor whose href is a vocabulary's own
address — FR-013 stated two ways, because the template can regain a link without the view changing.
Also scan every shipped template for reader-visible text outside a translation tag.

**Proves**: FR-011, FR-013, SC-006, User Story 1 scenario 7.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py tests/test_ui/test_templates.py`.

**Depends on**: T008.

---

### T010 — The page is documented

**Files**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

A section covering what the page is, installing the extra (`pip install
django-controlled-vocabularies[ui]`), the applications a project adds to `INSTALLED_APPS` — the ui
app and django-mvp's own stack, quoted from the test project's settings so the list is one that
demonstrably works — mounting the routes with `include`, and reversing the route by name. State
plainly that entries do not yet link to a vocabulary, and why. CHANGELOG entry under Unreleased.

**Proves**: Article VI. **Verify**: the README's own instructions followed against the test project
produce the page.

**Depends on**: T009.

---

## Phase 3 — US-2: Narrow the list to the one you are after (P2, #144)

**This phase starts only after US-1 has landed.** The two stories are not independent: they edit the
same view module, the same page template and the same test module, and T011 rewrites the actions
block T006 writes. Dispatch them in sequence, in one checkout — not into parallel worktrees.

### T011 — A search narrows the list by name and by description

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py`,
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list.html`,
`tests/test_ui/test_views.py`

Set `search_fields = ["name", "description"]`; django-mvp's mixin reads `?q=`, strips it and applies
case-insensitive substring matching across those fields. Replace the page template's empty actions
block with a `GET` form of our own wrapping django-mvp's search action — the shipped search input
targets a form defined by the *filter* action, so rendering search alone yields a box that submits
nothing (research R4). Render the submit button in our own template as `{% trans "Search" %}` rather
than relying on django-mvp's, whose label is a hard-coded English literal the component exposes no
variable for. Leave a comment naming the upstream issue covering both.

Test, in `TestVocabularySearch`: a word from a name narrows to that vocabulary; a word appearing only
in a description does too; matching ignores case; a term containing `%`, `_` or a quote is looked for
literally and matches nothing rather than everything; a non-Latin term matches its vocabulary. Assert
the rendered page carries the search input and no sort or filter control, and that submitting the
form reaches the view with `?q=` set — the defect being worked around is silent otherwise.

**Proves**: FR-006, SC-006, User Story 2 scenarios 1 to 3 and 7.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py -k Search`.

**Depends on**: T009.

---

### T012 — A search survives being linked to, and being paged through

**Files**: `tests/test_ui/test_views.py`

No production change is expected: django-mvp builds pagination links with Django's `querystring`
tag, which keeps every parameter but the page. This task proves that rather than assuming it —
the reference package carries a strict xfail for the opposite behaviour on an older version.

Test: requesting the page with `?q=` returns the narrowed set, and requesting the same address again
returns the same set in the same order; with more vocabularies than fit a page, following the
rendered link to page two — read out of the markup, never constructed by hand — keeps the search
applied; and the second page's results are a continuation of the same narrowed set rather than of
the full one.

**Proves**: FR-007, FR-008, FR-010, User Story 2 scenarios 5 and 6.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py -k Search`.

**Depends on**: T011.

---

### T013 — A search matching nothing says so, in its own words

**Files**: `controlled_vocabularies/ui/views.py`,
`controlled_vocabularies/ui/templates/controlled_vocabularies/ui/conceptscheme_list.html`,
`tests/test_ui/test_views.py`

Branch both empty-state methods on whether a search term was given: with one, say nothing matched and
repeat the term; without one, keep T009's wording. A mistyped word is invisible once the search box
is the only record of it, and telling someone whose search missed that the site is empty is a false
statement the page has the information to avoid. The echoed term is escaped by the template layer.

**The way back to the full list is a link in the actions block T011 owns**, not markup inside the
message. django-mvp's empty-state component renders heading and message as autoescaped strings with
no slot and no block, so an anchor in the message would render as literal text — and the obvious
repair, `mark_safe` over a string that also carries the search term, would emit an attacker-supplied
term unescaped. Both methods return plain translatable text; neither uses `mark_safe` or
`format_html`. Do not override `{% block page.content %}`.

Test: a search matching nothing returns 200 with the no-match wording, the term echoed, and a link
to the unsearched page; an empty database with no search keeps T009's wording, and shows no such
link; the two messages are different strings; and a term containing markup is escaped in the
response — assert on the escaped form, since a message rendered through `mark_safe` would pass a
substring check for the raw term.

**Proves**: FR-009, FR-011, User Story 2 scenario 4.
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_ui/test_views.py -k Search`.

**Depends on**: T012.

---

### T014 — Search is documented

**Files**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

Extend the browsing section: what the search covers (names and descriptions, not concepts), that
it travels in the address so a narrowed list can be shared, and that there is no filtering. Say
that a second word **widens** rather than narrows — matching is OR across every word and both
fields — because the opposite is what a reader assumes. Say what it does not do — finding a concept
without knowing its vocabulary — so a reader is not left inferring it.

**Proves**: Article VI. **Verify**: the documented behaviour matches the tests.

**Depends on**: T013.

---

## Out of scope, deliberately

- Any link into a vocabulary — #141.
- Searching concepts across vocabularies — no roadmap item covers it; raised at the spec gate.
- Filtering by any axis, including tags, which do not exist.
- Anything about performance beyond a flat query count — R7.
