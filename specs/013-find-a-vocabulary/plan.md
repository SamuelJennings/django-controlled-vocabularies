# Implementation Plan: Find a vocabulary

**Branch**: `013-find-a-vocabulary` | **Date**: 2026-08-19 | **Spec**: [`spec.md`](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/013-find-a-vocabulary/spec.md`

## Summary

One page lists every vocabulary the site holds, searchable by name and description. The page is the
package's first human-facing HTML surface, so the plan is mostly about *where it lives*: a new inner
app, `controlled_vocabularies/ui/`, whose dependency on django-mvp is a packaging extra rather than a
runtime dependency, so a project consuming vocabularies without ever rendering them is unaffected.
django-mvp's `MVPListView` supplies search, pagination, the page shell and the empty state; this
feature supplies one view, one row partial, one page template, one route, and the tests and
documentation for them.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 floor for the package; the ui extra requires 3.12 (django-mvp's
own floor), expressed as a dependency marker. CI runs 3.12 and 3.13.

**Primary Dependencies**: django-mvp `>=0.19,<1.0`, optional, in a new `ui` extra. No other new
dependency. Nothing is added to the hard dependency set.

**Storage**: none. Reads `ConceptScheme` and counts `Concept`; no model changes, no migration.

**Testing**: pytest + pytest-django, `tests/test_ui/` mirroring the new source modules, plus a
core-only settings module and a subprocess boot test proving the core still runs without the extra.

**Target Platform**: any Django project mounting the package's ui routes; also the package's own
test project.

**Project Type**: installable Django package (single project, library layout).

**Performance Goals**: query count per page independent of the number of vocabularies shown
(SC-005). Scale beyond tens of vocabularies is R7 and explicitly out of scope.

**Constraints**: no JavaScript requirement — the page works without it. No access rule of the
package's own. No link to a vocabulary's own page until #141 serves one.

**Scale/Scope**: two user stories, one new app, one view, two templates, one route, one extra. The
two stories run **in sequence, not in parallel** — US-2 extends the same view class and rewrites the
same template block US-1 writes, so parallel worktrees would collide at convergence.

## Constitution Check

| Article | Bearing on this feature | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| I Test-First | Every task lands its test before its code; view behaviour is asserted through the real client. | Follows |
| II Simplicity | django-mvp supplies search, pagination, the shell and the empty-state hooks. The only thing built here that is not a template or a view attribute is the system check in R2 — justified below. | Follows, one entry in Complexity Tracking |
| III Anti-Abstraction | No base view class, no mixin, no registry. One concrete view. The "is it imported" test stays in the template rather than becoming a model property, because one caller is not a second use. | Follows |
| IV Integration-First | Acceptance runs through `client.get(reverse(...))` against rendered HTML, which is how a person touches this. | Follows |
| V Security & data-safety | Everything rendered goes through the template layer. The search term is a queryset `icontains` argument, never interpolated — the ORM parameterises it, which is also what makes `%` and `_` ordinary characters. The term is echoed back to the reader through the template's escaping. No auth, no uploads, no outbound fetch. | Follows |
| VI Documentation | README gains a section on the browsing page, how to install the extra and how to mount the routes; CHANGELOG gains the entry. No built docs site exists in this repo. Ships in this PR. | Follows |
| VII Dependency discipline | One new dependency, optional, declared alongside the code that imports it, with a `deptry` module-name map so the check passes. | Follows |
| VIII Dual compatibility contract | No URI is composed, published or changed. The data contract is untouched. | N/A |
| IX URI identity & data safety | Read-only feature; no writes, no migration. | N/A |
| X Stack & architecture norms | Django 5.2/6.0, Poetry, ruff. Models stay the source of truth; the page reads them. | Follows |
| XI RDF fidelity | Untouched. | N/A |
| XII Internationalization | Every string the page shows is `{% trans %}` in templates and `gettext_lazy` in Python, including both empty-state messages. SC-006 is a test. | Follows |
| XIII Data-model conventions | No field added, so no indexing decision. Ordering is `Lower("name")` on an unindexed column, which is correct at this scale and is R7's to revisit. | Follows |
| XIV Test structure | `tests/test_ui/` mirrors `controlled_vocabularies/ui/`, one class per subject, factories reused from `tests/factories.py`. Template and packaging tests have no source module to mirror; T001 declares those four files under `[tool.forge.conformance] non-mirror-paths`. | Follows |
| XV Cohesion | One view class holds the list behaviour; no free functions. | Follows |

**Structure Decision**: inner app, not a second distribution. The alternative — a separate
`django-controlled-vocabularies-ui` package — costs a second release cadence and a version matrix
for a page. The extra gives the same isolation with one release. The isolation is not a convention
here but a tested property: three guard tests prove the core neither imports nor requires the UI
stack.

## Key design decisions

1. **`VocabularyListView(MVPListView)`** over `ConceptScheme`, with `search_fields = ["name",
   "description"]`, `ordering = [Lower("name"), "pk"]` as a class attribute, `get_queryset()`
   returning `.annotate(concept_count=Count("concepts"))`, and `list_item_template` naming the row
   partial. Page size is django-mvp's inherited default and is not restated. The ordering is a class
   attribute rather than an `.order_by()` call in `get_queryset()` because Django applies
   `self.ordering` innermost, before both django-mvp mixins — calling `.order_by()` in our own
   `get_queryset()` would apply it *after* the search mixin's `.distinct()`, which is the operand
   order upstream's own docstring says its mixin order exists to avoid.
   The two empty states are `get_empty_state_heading()` / `get_empty_state_message()` branching on
   `?q=`. Both return plain translatable text — never `mark_safe`, never `format_html`. They cannot
   carry a link: django-mvp's empty-state component renders both strings autoescaped with no slot,
   so markup in them would show as literal text, and marking them safe would emit the search term
   unescaped.
2. **The page template owns the actions block.** django-mvp renders search, sort, filter and create
   by default; this page wants search alone, and django-mvp's search input targets a form its filter
   action defines (research R4). The template overrides the block with a `GET` form of our own
   wrapping django-mvp's search action, our own `{% trans %}`d submit button (django-mvp's ships a
   hard-coded English label its component does not expose), and — when a search term is set — the
   link back to the unsearched list that FR-009 requires. Everything else is inherited;
   `{% block page.content %}` is not overridden.
3. **The row is a Cotton card partial** — name, description, concept count, and origin. Imported
   vocabularies show the publisher's identifier as text, never as a link. No element links to the
   vocabulary itself (FR-013).
4. **`app_name = "controlled_vocabularies_ui"`**, distinct from the core's
   `controlled_vocabularies` namespace, so both can be mounted in one project without either
   shadowing the other's reverses. Route name `vocabulary-list` at the empty path.
5. **A system check, not an import guard.** `ui/apps.py` `ready()` registers a check that reports
   an error naming the extra when `mvp` is not importable, so a misconfigured project learns at
   `manage.py check` rather than on its first request.

## Complexity Tracking

| Addition | Why it is not YAGNI |
|---|---|
| `ui/checks.py` — one function, one check | The failure it replaces is a raw `ModuleNotFoundError: mvp` raised from URL loading, which names neither the extra nor the app that needs it. The reference implementation lacks this and its own review flagged the gap. It is a function and a registration, not a layer. |
| Second settings module + subprocess boot test | The claim "the core does not require django-mvp" is otherwise untestable in a process that has already imported it. This is the same mechanism the repo already uses to prove the admin is optional. |

## Risks

- **django-mvp's INSTALLED_APPS surface is wide** — cotton, icons, menus, crispy and its own app.
  A consuming project must install all of them, and the README has to say so exactly. Mitigation:
  the test project's settings are the working example, and the README quotes them.
- **Two upstream defects are worked around in our page template** — the search input targets a form
  only the filter action defines (research R4), and the search component's submit button carries a
  hard-coded English label it does not expose as a variable. Both workarounds will look redundant
  once django-mvp fixes them. Mitigation: one issue filed upstream covering both, and a comment in
  the template pointing at it.
- **Coverage floors** (project 90%, patch 85%) with a new app that is mostly templates. Mitigation:
  the view and check carry real tests; template behaviour is asserted through rendered HTML.
