# Implementation Plan — 011 Choose a concept by typing instead of scrolling

**Branch**: `011-choose-concept-by-typing` · **Spec**: `spec.md` · **Research**: `research.md` ·
**Decisions**: `decisions.md` · **Issue**: #88 · **Serves**: G2, G5 · **Roadmap**: R3

## Summary

Make both consumption fields render, by default, as a control a person types into. The vocabulary
never reaches the page: the control asks a search endpoint this package carries, the endpoint works
out for itself which concepts the declaring field allows, and it answers a bounded page at a time.

The search behaviour is adopted, not written. `research.md` evaluated three routes and lands on
**django-tomselect**, which is the maintainer's recommendation and also what the evidence supports:
one runtime dependency (`django>=4.2.29`, no transitive packages), MIT, Python 3.11–3.14, no jQuery
anywhere in its chain, bundled assets, and a pagination contract that already clamps page size
server-side. This package writes the parts that are specific to it — which concepts a declaration
allows, and how a concept is matched and displayed across three kinds of label — and inherits the
rest.

**Verified against the artefact, not the branch.** `research.md` read `main` on GitHub. Every API
fact this plan depends on was re-checked against the published wheel `django_tomselect-2026.6.2-py3-none-any.whl`,
because a plan built on a repository's default branch is a plan built on code nobody will install.
Findings that changed as a result are in `decisions.md` D7 to D11 and in Risks below.

The shape of the work:

| What the spec asks | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| Control is the default representation of both fields (FR-001) | `formfield()` on each model field, returning this package's form field (A3) |
| Package carries the endpoint, project chooses the address (FR-002) | this package's own `urls.py`, included once (A2) |
| Nothing of the vocabulary in the page (FR-003) | inherited — the widget renders one `<select>` and no options (A1) |
| Match across preferred, alternative and hidden labels (FR-004) | `search()` override, one `Q` over the label table plus the default-language column (A4) |
| Display under the preferred label, name the vocabulary (FR-005) | `virtual_fields` + `prepare_results()` over `display_label` (A5) |
| Restriction derived from the declaration, never from the request (FR-006) | `get_queryset()` resolves the field reference and applies its `limit_choices_to` (A6) |
| Bounded, stable paging (FR-007) | inherited, with a total order and one override for the past-the-end case (A7) |
| Existing record shows what it holds (FR-008) | inherited, verified against the restricted queryset (A8) |
| Route missing is reported by the existing check (FR-010) | `checks.py`, widened (A9) |

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ · **Framework**: Django 5.2 LTS and 6.0
**New runtime dependency**: `django-tomselect ^2026.6.2` — justified in `decisions.md` D7, declared
alongside `views.py`/`forms.py`, which are the first code to import it (Article VII).
**Testing**: pytest + pytest-django + factory_boy from `mvp-shared[test]`.
**Storage**: no model change. No migration in this package. The test app gains none.
**Target**: any Django project installing this package.

**What exists and is being used, not rebuilt:**

| Surface | Where | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `ConceptFieldMixin` | `fields.py:29` | the shared `vocabulary` contract; the `formfield()` override lands here once, not twice |
| `ConceptField` / `ConceptsField` | `fields.py:146`, `fields.py` | the two declarations the endpoint resolves |
| `limit_choices_to` = `Q(scheme__slug__in=…)` | `fields.py:105` | **the restriction itself** — already declarative, already server-side, already the thing the form uses (A6) |
| `Concept.label` | `models.py:626` | the default-language preferred label, a column — one half of FR-004 |
| `ConceptLabel` (`concept.labels`) | `models.py` | language + kind + text — the other half of FR-004 |
| `Concept.display_label()` | `models.py:750` | FR-005, per result |
| `check_concept_field_vocabularies` | `checks.py:22` | FR-010, widened rather than joined by a second mechanism |
| `AutocompleteModelView` | `django_tomselect/autocompletes.py:141` | the endpoint's base — pagination, JSON shape, request parsing |
| `TomSelectModelChoiceField` / `…MultipleChoiceField` | `django_tomselect/forms.py:389`, `:401` | ordinary `ModelChoiceField` subclasses, returnable from `formfield()` |
| `get_autocomplete_params()` | `django_tomselect/widgets.py:244` | the documented hook that carries the field reference to the endpoint (A6) |

## Constitution Check

| Article | Bearing on this feature | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| I — Test-First | Every task writes its test first. The two most likely to be asserted vacuously are FR-003 (must assert the *rendered* form carries no concept options at two vocabulary sizes, not that a widget class was chosen) and FR-006 (must assert against a real altered request, not that a helper returns a `Q`). | Pass, watched |
| II — Simplicity | Four overrides on one view, one `formfield()`, one `urls.py`, one widened check. No custom manager, no queryset class, no serializer, no template of our own. | Pass |
| III — Anti-Abstraction | The `formfield()` override goes on the existing mixin because both fields share the `vocabulary` contract it derives from. No new base class. | Pass |
| IV — Integration-First | Exercised through real `ModelForm`s built from the test app's existing consuming models and through real requests to the routed endpoint. | Pass |
| V — Security & data-safety | The whole of A6, plus the two allowlists closed explicitly (D8). The endpoint carries no permission rule by design (D3), which the README states rather than implies. | Pass |
| VI — Documentation | README gains both wiring steps, what the endpoint exposes, how to restrict it, and the browser requirement. `CONTEXT.md` gains the terms. CHANGELOG records the addition. | Pass |
| VII — Dependency discipline | One dependency, justified in D7 against the alternatives, declared alongside the code that imports it. It carries no transitive runtime packages, which is why deptry stays quiet. | Pass |
| VIII — Compatibility | `django-tomselect` declares `django>=4.2.29` and Python `>=3.11,<4.0`, classifying 5.2 and 6.0 — wider than this package's floor on both axes, so it constrains nothing this package promises. The public names added (`ConceptChoiceField`, `ConceptsChoiceField`, the URL name) enter the API contract. | Pass |
| IX — URI identity | The endpoint returns a concept's identifier and label. It creates nothing and changes nothing. | Pass |
| X — Stack & architecture | Models stay the source of truth. No RDF here. | Pass |
| XII — Internationalization | Every string the control, endpoint and check put in front of a person is wrapped, with named placeholders. Matching runs in the **active** language, which is what makes this article behavioural here rather than cosmetic. | Pass, watched |
| XIV — Test structure | New modules mirror the source tree: `tests/test_views.py`, `tests/test_forms.py`, `tests/test_urls.py`. Consuming models and factories are the shared ones FS-009 and FS-010 left. | Pass |
| XV — Cohesion | The view knows about concepts and declarations. It knows nothing about HTTP shapes beyond what it inherits, and the form field knows nothing about querysets. | Pass |

## Approach

### A1 — The rendered page carries no vocabulary (FR-003)

Inherited and asserted, not built. `TomSelectModelWidget` renders a single `<select>` carrying data
attributes and no `<option>` per eligible concept, so rendered size is independent of vocabulary
size. This is the feature's headline claim and the one most easily satisfied in appearance only, so
the test renders a real `ModelForm` against a vocabulary of a handful and again against one of
several thousand, and asserts the rendered output is the same length. Asserting "the widget is a
TomSelect widget" would pass while the page still grew.

### A2 — One URL configuration, at an address the project chooses (FR-002)

`controlled_vocabularies/urls.py`, new:

```python
app_name = "controlled_vocabularies"
urlpatterns = [path("concepts/", ConceptAutocompleteView.as_view(), name="concept-autocomplete")]
```

The project writes `path("vocabularies/", include("controlled_vocabularies.urls"))` — prefix its
own. The widget resolves the *name*, never a path, so the prefix is honoured (`safe_reverse` in
`widgets.py:237`).

`research.md` flagged Req 1 as unmet by either candidate, on the grounds that a consuming project
must write the `path()` entry itself. That reads the requirement one layer out. The consumer of
`django-tomselect` here is **this package**, which is exactly the party that should own the
endpoint, and the wheel shipping no `urls.py` of its own is what leaves this package free to. The
requirement is met as written; the flag is resolved, not carried (D9).

### A3 — The control is the default, with nothing declared per field (FR-001)

`ConceptFieldMixin.formfield()` returns this package's form field, so a project's ordinary
`ModelForm` gets the control from the model declaration alone. Both model fields inherit it from
the one mixin. The form field classes are thin:

- `ConceptChoiceField(TomSelectModelChoiceField)` and `ConceptsChoiceField(TomSelectModelMultipleChoiceField)` —
  both are ordinary `ModelChoiceField` subclasses, so `formfield()` returning them is the standard
  Django pattern rather than anything the library has to permit.
- their widgets subclass `TomSelectModelWidget` / `TomSelectModelMultipleWidget` and override
  `get_autocomplete_params()` (A6).
- the config pins `css_framework` to the framework-free default, so this package imposes no
  Bootstrap on a project that uses none.

`formfield()` passes through everything Django gives it — `required`, `label`, `help_text`,
`queryset`, `limit_choices_to` — so FR-009's "every guarantee already made is unchanged" holds by
not intervening.

### A4 — Matched by any of its names (FR-004)

Override `search()` on the view. `search_lookups`, the inherited mechanism, expresses one flat list
of ORM lookups and cannot express "the active language's labels, of three kinds, or the
default-language column", so it is left empty and the method is replaced:

```python
Q(label__icontains=query)
| Q(labels__language=active, labels__kind__in=PREFERRED_ALTERNATIVE_HIDDEN, labels__text__icontains=query)
```

then `.distinct()`, which is what makes a concept matching on several of its labels appear once
(FR-004). `icontains` gives case-insensitivity portably and folds no accents, which is D4 stated in
code. The active language is `get_language()`, falling back to `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` when
translation is inactive.

### A5 — Shown under one name, with its vocabulary (FR-005)

`value_fields = ["id"]`, `virtual_fields = ["display_label", "vocabulary"]`, and a `prepare_results()`
override that reads `Concept.display_label()` — which already resolves the active language and falls
back to the vocabulary's default — and the scheme's label. `get_queryset()` carries
`select_related("scheme")` and `prefetch_related("labels")`, because `display_label()` walks
`self.labels.all()` and a bounded page would otherwise cost a query per row.

The vocabulary is returned on every result rather than only when a field spans several. FR-005 makes
it conditional; always returning it is one behaviour instead of two, costs one already-selected
attribute, and is inside what FR-012 permits the endpoint to expose.

### A6 — The restriction is derived, never received (FR-006)

The load-bearing part of the feature. Three pieces:

1. **The reference the control sends.** The widget overrides `get_autocomplete_params()` — a
   documented hook that reaches the rendered attributes and the browser plugin
   (`widgets.py:440` → `templates/django_tomselect/tomselect.html:193`) — and appends
   `field=<app_label>.<model>.<field_name>`. It is a *reference to a declaration*, never a
   restriction: nothing in it says which vocabulary, and altering it cannot widen anything.
2. **Resolution, in `get_queryset()`.** Look the reference up through the app registry; require the
   resolved field to be an instance of this package's `ConceptFieldMixin`; apply
   `queryset.complex_filter(field.get_limit_choices_to())`. `complex_filter` is Django's own path
   for exactly this and handles the empty case, so a declaration naming no vocabulary makes every
   concept eligible — its meaning, not an exemption (FR-006).
3. **Refusal that discloses nothing.** A reference that fails to resolve, names a field that is not
   one of this package's, or is absent, returns `Concept.objects.none()` — an ordinary empty page,
   HTTP 200, identical in shape and status to a search that matched nothing. No exception escapes,
   so a missing model and an existing-but-wrong field are indistinguishable from outside.

**Two request-controlled surfaces are closed explicitly** (`research.md`, confirmed in the wheel):
`allowed_filter_fields = []` and `allowed_ordering_fields = []`. Both default to `None`, which the
library treats as "validate that the field exists on the model" rather than "reject" — so by default
a hand-edited request can filter or order by any field on `Concept`. The values never leak, but
an unclosed filter is a boolean oracle over the model. The empty list is checked with `is not None`
in both places (`autocompletes.py:500`, `:696`), so `[]` genuinely blocks rather than falling back.
The test for this alters a real request and asserts the results are unchanged (D8).

### A7 — Bounded and stable (FR-007)

`page_size = 20`, and the inherited clamp at `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 200` already refuses a request asking
for more. Stability needs a **total** order: `ordering = ("label", "pk")`, because `label` is unique
only within a vocabulary and a field naming none can span several. `pk` breaks the tie, so
successive pages neither repeat nor skip.

One override. The inherited `paginate_queryset()` catches `EmptyPage` and returns **page 1**
(`autocompletes.py:743`), which would make a request past the end silently re-serve the beginning —
the spec's edge case says it returns nothing and says no more exist. The override is the empty-page
branch only; everything else is inherited.

### A8 — An existing record shows what it holds (FR-008)

Inherited, and verified rather than assumed. The widget resolves already-attached instances
server-side to render them as selected. Two properties need asserting because a plausible
implementation gets either wrong: labels must come out as `display_label()` in the active language
rather than `str(obj)`, and a concept whose vocabulary the declaration no longer names must still
render — if the widget builds selected options through the same restricted queryset the endpoint
uses, it will silently drop that concept and a person will save the emptiness back. Where the
inherited behaviour fails either, the fix is a `get_context()` override on this package's widget.

### A9 — The missing route is reported at check time (FR-010, and the second wiring step)

Widen `check_concept_field_vocabularies`'s neighbour in `checks.py` with two warnings, both
database-free:

- the package's URL configuration is not included anywhere in the project — reverse the URL name
  and report what to add when it fails;
- `django_tomselect` is not in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

The second exists because the wheel ships its templates and static assets inside its own app
directory, so Django's app-directories template loader and static finder only see them when the app
is installed. **This is a second thing a project must do, and the spec promised one.** It is
recorded as D10, the spec text is amended rather than quietly stretched, and it is on the list for
the plan gate because it changes an acceptance scenario the maintainer approved. Both stay warnings,
matching the existing check: a project mid-setup is not broken.

### A10 — Assets, strings, documentation (FR-011, FR-013, FR-014, FR-015)

Assets are the dependency's, reached through Django's ordinary form-media mechanism — this package
ships no JavaScript, no CSS and no template of its own, which is the cheapest way to satisfy FR-011
and the one with nothing to maintain. Strings are wrapped with named placeholders. README gains the
two wiring steps, what the endpoint exposes, how a project restricts access to it, and the
JavaScript requirement. `CONTEXT.md` gains the terms. CHANGELOG records the addition, and the
dependency is declared alongside `views.py`.

## Risks

| # | Risk | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | The widget builds already-selected options through the restricted queryset, dropping a concept whose vocabulary the field no longer names (FR-008). | A8 asserts it directly on a real record. A `get_context()` override is the fallback and is budgeted in T009. |
| R2 | `.distinct()` over a join with `order_by("label", "pk")` is correct on PostgreSQL and SQLite but is the kind of thing that differs. | The paging test runs against a match set larger than one page and asserts two successive pages are disjoint and complete, on the suite's real database. |
| R3 | A second live session or a later Django release changes `get_autocomplete_params()`'s wiring, and the field reference silently stops being sent — the endpoint would then return *everything* the fallback allows. | The refusal is fail-closed: an absent reference returns no results, so a broken wiring produces an empty control rather than an unrestricted one. Asserted as its own case. |
| R4 | Single-maintainer dependency (`research.md` Req 8: one maintainer, 87 stars against DAL's 1,870). | Named in D7 with what it would cost to leave: this package's own code is four overrides and a `formfield()`, so the escape is the widget layer, not the feature. |
| R5 | `display_label()` per result reintroduces a query per row. | `prefetch_related("labels")` in `get_queryset()`, asserted with `assertNumQueries` over a full page rather than by inspection. |

## Complexity Tracking

**Why the endpoint is one view rather than one per field.** Both fields target `Concept`, and the
restriction arrives as a reference the view resolves. A view per declaration would put the
restriction in the URL configuration, which is where a project could edit it — the opposite of
FR-006 — and would need a route per consuming field.

**Why the reference is a plain dotted path and not a signed token.** Signing would make tampering
pointless rather than merely useless, but nothing is being protected: the reference carries no
restriction, and every failure path already returns the same empty page. A signature would add key
rotation, a longer URL and a second failure mode to explain, to guard a value whose alteration
already achieves nothing. Article II, and D11.

**Why `formfield()` lands on the mixin.** `ConceptFieldMixin` exists because the `vocabulary`
contract was previously restated in both fields and drifted. The default form representation is
derived from that same contract. Putting it anywhere else reopens the drift the mixin closed.
