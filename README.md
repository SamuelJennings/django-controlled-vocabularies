# django-controlled-vocabularies

A Django app for **managing, publishing, and consuming SKOS controlled vocabularies** — built for
research organisations. Curators create and edit vocabularies through a web interface; developers
attach concepts to their own models and serve standards-compliant RDF at stable URIs. No hand-edited
RDF, no code releases to add a term, no triplestore to operate.

> **Status:** early development (pre-`0.1`). The data model and design are sketched out (see
> [`docs/brainstorm.md`](docs/brainstorm.md)); the first release targets **consumption** (import,
> models, a concept relationship field, and RDF export) ahead of the editing interface. See
> [`GOALS.md`](GOALS.md).

## Scope & philosophy

Research data infrastructure runs on controlled vocabularies, but Django has no native way to manage
or consume them, and the existing editors are foreign stacks, unmaintained, or deployment-heavy.
This app closes that gap by treating a vocabulary as **relational data, not a document**: concepts
are Django models, the database is the source of truth, and RDF is a projection produced only at the
import/export boundary. That turns everything Django already does well (forms, permissions, indexed
search, referential integrity) onto vocabulary management, and lets vocabularies scale to tens of
thousands of concepts and evolve as data rather than code.

**It deliberately is:**

- SKOS-focused.
- A Django app — installable into any Django project (notably FairDM) and runnable standalone.
- Both a **manager** (author, edit, version, publish) and a **consumer** (attach concepts to your
  models via a field; serve RDF at stable URIs).

**It deliberately is not:**

- A general RDF/OWL toolkit — the SKOS-only scope is intentional.
- A triplestore or SPARQL endpoint — the relational database is the store.
- A replacement for rdflib — rdflib is used only to parse and serialize at the boundary.
- A reasoner — no OWL inference.
- An editor for external vocabularies — imported external vocabularies are read-only references.
- A way to extend a published vocabulary with your own terms — that is out of scope.
- A faithful mirror of imported external vocabularies — imports are normalised to what the app
  supports (e.g. its configured languages); unsupported languages and constructs are not stored.

**Tie-breaks, when principles collide:** the database is the source of truth over RDF fidelity in
memory · lossless round-tripping over schema neatness · stable concept URIs over convenient
identifiers · vocabulary-as-data over vocabulary-as-code · SKOS fidelity over generality.

## Configuration

Concept and scheme URIs are composed from a base address. Set it in your Django settings:

```python
CONTROLLED_VOCABULARIES_BASE_URI = "https://vocab.example.org/vocabularies"
```

If you leave it unset, the app falls back to `http://localhost:8000/vocabularies` so it still
runs out of the box — set a real address before you rely on the URIs anywhere they are seen. A
concept's URI is then `{base}/{scheme-slug}/{concept-slug}`, and the slugs follow the labels while
a vocabulary is unpublished.

## Relationship to other packages

Supersedes and retires `skos-builder` and `django-research-vocabs`, consolidating vocabulary
authoring, management, and Django consumption into one app.
