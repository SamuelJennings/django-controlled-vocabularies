"""Tests for the test project's URL wiring of ``controlled_vocabularies.urls`` (T002, FR-002).

The package's own ``urls.py`` is included under a non-empty prefix chosen by this
test project (``vocabularies/``), never at the root, because a root inclusion would
never catch a hard-coded path in the widget's ``url`` argument.
