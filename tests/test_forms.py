"""Tests for ``controlled_vocabularies.forms`` (T004, FR-001, FR-003, FR-009).

``TestConceptFieldRendersAsTheControl`` — an ordinary ``ModelForm`` built from a
consuming model, with no widget declared and no form field declared, gets this
package's control from ``ConceptFieldMixin.formfield()`` alone (FR-001).

``TestConceptFieldRenderingIsBoundedByVocabularySize`` — FR-003 properly: the
control renders no concept into the page, so the rendered length and the absence
of any concept's label hold identically whether the vocabulary is five concepts
or several thousand.

``TestConceptFieldSubmissionSurvives`` — decisions.md D12 is the point of this
task: the widget's own ``get_queryset()`` builds the validation queryset from the
model field instance directly, with no request consulted, so a legitimate
submission does not fail with ``invalid_choice`` the way it would if validation
fell back to the library's default (an ambient request whose ``GET`` is empty
during a POST). Both the single- (``ConceptField``) and multiple-valued
(``ConceptsField``) fields are proved, and a foreign concept is still refused —
FR-009 promises nothing already guaranteed was taken away.
