"""``controlled_vocabularies.management.rendering`` — an ``ImportReport`` as
translated lines for a terminal (T015, T016, T017, T018, FR-006, FR-007,
FR-008, plan.md "Rendering").

The bucket counts (created, updated, set aside, normalized, absent from
source), the set-aside account (grouped by reason with a count each, and the
per-language account), records absent from the source named in their own
section, and per-entry set-aside detail at raised verbosity, carried by
Django's own ``--verbosity`` rather than a new flag (decisions.md D6).

Exercised mostly against a hand-built :class:`ImportReport` (tasks.md T015);
``TestReportRendererAgainstARealRun`` and ``TestReportRendererAbsentFromSource``
exercise the same rendering against a report a real ``import_skos`` run
produces, so it is proven without needing a full import for every scenario
(tasks.md T016/T017).
