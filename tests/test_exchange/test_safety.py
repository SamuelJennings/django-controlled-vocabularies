"""T004 — the pre-flight safety scan of untrusted RDF/XML (research.md R3, decisions.md D9).

`rdflib`'s RDF/XML parser calls `xml.sax.make_parser()` itself, so a defused
parser cannot be substituted directly; `scan_rdf_xml` is the pre-flight check
that stands in front of it. This reinstates the actual measured defect — the
eight-level nested-entity bomb from research.md R3 — as the test input, rather
than a mock, so the control is proven against the real one.
