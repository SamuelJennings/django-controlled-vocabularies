"""``controlled_vocabularies.exchange.skos`` — reading a published SKOS file
into records (tasks.md Phase US-1).

Grows one task at a time, mirroring the module. T006 covers only
``_read_graph``: a file becomes an ``rdflib.Graph``, the serialization is
stated or determined, and RDF/XML is routed through the T004 safety scan
before rdflib ever sees it.
