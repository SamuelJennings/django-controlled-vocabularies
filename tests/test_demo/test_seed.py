"""``seed_demo`` is one command, destructive and repeatable (T016, FR-016, User Story 3
scenarios 2 and 3).

Runs the real command against the test database via ``call_command`` given a ``Command``
instance directly, rather than by name — the standard way to exercise a management command
that lives in an app not installed for the test suite (``demo`` carries only the front end's
own settings and urlconf under ``tests.settings``, T015). Nothing about the command itself is
faked: the same ``ConceptScheme``/``Concept`` models and the same
``controlled_vocabularies.exchange.import_skos`` path a real run uses.

There is no ``demo/management/commands/test_seed_demo.py`` for this to mirror by Article X's
own rule — this file's subject is the command's observable behaviour against the demo's own
seed content, not a module under ``controlled_vocabularies/`` — so it is part of the
``tests/test_demo/`` non-mirror exception (``[tool.forge.conformance] non-mirror-paths``, T015).
