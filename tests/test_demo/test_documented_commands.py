"""The commands the README documents are the commands the unattended walk runs (SC-007).

The demo's whole claim is that a stranger can follow three commands from a fresh clone and see
the page. Nothing else in this suite reads the README, so the documented commands could drift
from the working ones — and did: the section first shipped calling a bare ``python manage.py``,
which on a machine whose path carries only ``python3`` fails at the demo's own first step, while
every test here and the walk in CI passed, because both go through ``poetry run``.

There is no ``demo/test_documented_commands.py`` for this to mirror — the subject is the README
and the workflow agreeing with each other — so this file is a non-mirror exception
(``[tool.forge.conformance] non-mirror-paths``).
