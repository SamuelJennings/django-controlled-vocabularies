"""Tests for ``controlled_vocabularies.fields``.

Phase F covers ``ConceptField`` construction and ``deconstruct()``, unbound to
any consuming model — no model declares the field yet, so every test here
builds the field directly rather than through a model instance. The bound
behaviour (declaring it on a model, saving, reading back) is US-1's (T004),
and the ``validate()`` override's behavioural proof — raise, then read
``.messages`` and find the vocabulary named — is US-2's T005, against a real
test-app model. Neither is in scope here: with ``to`` the string
``"controlled_vocabularies.Concept"`` (not the imported class — see
``fields.py``'s module docstring for why), ``remote_field.model`` only
resolves once the field is attached to a model class, so an unbound field
cannot run ``validate()`` at all.

- ``TestConceptFieldConstruction`` — the fixed kwargs, the two construction-time
  rejections, that building the field issues no query (FR-003's mechanism),
  and that ``error_messages["invalid"]`` carries the named placeholder
  ``validate()`` needs (proved bound in T005).
- ``TestConceptFieldMigrations`` — a model carrying the field migrates from
  zero and stays ``makemigrations --check`` clean, which is what the string
  ``to`` and ``deconstruct()`` together exist to make possible.
- ``TestConceptFieldFactories`` and ``TestConceptVocabularyFixtures`` — the
  test-app factories and the two scheme fixtures ``conftest.py`` carries for
  #87, #88 and #89 build the shape their docstrings promise.
- ``TestConceptFieldDeconstruct`` — ``deconstruct()`` strips the three kwargs
  this field fixes and adds ``vocabulary``, so a field built from the emitted
  path/kwargs round-trips (T003, moved into Phase F because
  ``ModelState.from_model()`` clones every field through ``deconstruct()``,
  so T002's test app cannot migrate without it).
- ``TestConceptFieldRoundTrip`` — T004 (US-1): declaring the field on a real
  model, saving, and reading back a concept survives a save/reload; the
  optional field validates and saves with nothing attached; and using the
  field this way stays ``makemigrations --check`` clean, the regression guard
  against ``deconstruct()`` rotting.
- ``TestConceptFieldOrdinaryOptions`` — T004 (US-1): the field's ordinary
  ``ForeignKey`` options — ``related_name``, ``null``/``blank``,
  ``verbose_name``, ``help_text``, the automatic index — behave exactly as
  they would on a plain ``ForeignKey``, asserted directly on the bound field
  rather than only through a save/reload round trip.
- ``TestConceptFieldValidation`` — T005 (US-2): ``full_clean()`` on a record
  holding a concept from another vocabulary raises ``ValidationError``, and
  *reading* ``.messages`` shows the vocabulary named — the behavioural proof
  T001's ``validate()`` override exists for, only reachable against a real,
  bound model. A concept from the correct vocabulary passes; an optional
  field with nothing attached passes.
- ``TestConceptFieldFormChoices`` — T006 (US-2): a ``ModelForm`` generated
  from a consuming model offers only the named vocabulary's concepts as
  choices, and a submission carrying another vocabulary's concept is
  rejected rather than saved — proof that ``ForeignKey.formfield()`` passes
  ``limit_choices_to`` through, since nothing in this package's own source
  states that guarantee.
- ``TestConceptFieldDeleteGuard`` — T007 (US-3): no new code — ``PROTECT``
  was fixed on the field in T001. This class is the proof FR-007 needs: a
  referenced concept survives both a single-instance and a bulk queryset
  delete, the scheme holding it survives too (the cascade from scheme to
  concept meets the protection on the way down), an unreferenced concept
  deletes normally, and deleting the referencing record leaves the concept
  in place.
- ``TestConceptsFieldWritePathVocabularyCheck`` — FS-010 T005 (US-2): the
  ``pre_add`` receiver connected in ``ConceptsField.contribute_to_class``
  refuses a concept from an unnamed vocabulary at the point the relation is
  written (D2), not only at model validation. Driven entirely through
  :class:`~tests.testapp.models.Deposit`'s real relation manager — never
  against the receiver directly, since a direct call would pass even if
  Django's ``bulk_create`` fast path were skipping ``m2m_changed`` entirely
  (R6), which is precisely the failure this task guards against.
- ``TestConceptsFieldFormChoices`` — FS-010 T006 (US-2): no new code —
  ``limit_choices_to`` from T002 already restricts a ``ModelForm``'s
  ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` queryset and rejects an out-of-vocabulary
  submission, the same way T006 (FS-009) already proved for ``ConceptField``.
- ``TestConceptsFieldDeleteGuard`` — FS-010 T007 (US-3): no new code —
  ``PROTECT`` on the membership model's foreign key to ``Concept`` (T003)
  already refuses any delete path that would strand a reference. This class
  is the proof, the ``ConceptsField`` counterpart of
  ``TestConceptFieldDeleteGuard``: a held concept survives both a
  single-instance and a bulk queryset delete, the scheme holding it survives
  too, an unheld concept deletes normally, and deleting the consuming record
  removes only its membership rows and leaves every concept in place (D5).
- ``TestConceptsFieldLabelAndUriAccessors`` — FS-010 T008 (US-4, FR-008,
  FR-009): ``contribute_to_class()`` gives the consuming model
  ``get_<name>_labels()`` and ``get_<name>_uris()``, plural, named the way
  ``ConceptField``'s own singular accessors are (T011's precedent). Labels
  delegate to ``Concept.display_label()`` per attached concept, in the
  active language with fallback to the vocabulary's default; URIs return
  each concept's own ``uri`` unchanged. Both return an empty result rather
  than raising for a record holding nothing, including an unsaved one —
  the many-to-many manager raises ``ValueError`` the moment it is touched
  before a primary key exists. The ``setattr`` is guarded exactly like
  ``ConceptField``'s.
- ``TestConceptsFieldSeveralVocabulariesWritePath`` and
  ``TestConceptsFieldSeveralVocabulariesFormChoices`` — FS-010 T012 (US-8,
  FR-002, FR-005, FR-006, D9): the several-vocabulary shape against
  :class:`~tests.testapp.models.FieldNote` — a concept from either named
  vocabulary attaches, a concept from a third is refused with both expected
  vocabularies named in the message, and a form built from the model offers
  only the two named vocabularies' concepts.
- ``TestConceptsFieldNoVocabularyWritePath``,
  ``TestConceptsFieldNoVocabularyFormChoices`` and
  ``TestConceptsFieldNoVocabularyDeleteGuard`` — FS-010 T012 (US-8, FR-002,
  FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, D9): the no-vocabulary shape against
  :class:`~tests.testapp.models.Photograph` — concepts from several distinct
  vocabularies all attach in one write with none refused, a form built from
  the model offers every concept in the database, and the delete guard holds
  without a restriction to enforce, proving the unconstrained shape is a real
  member of the family rather than a plain many-to-many wearing the same
  name. The receiver-absence assertion this shape also needs already lives
  on ``TestConceptsFieldWritePathVocabularyCheck`` (T005) and the several-
  vocabulary system-check coverage already lives on
  ``TestCheckConceptsFieldVocabularies`` (T010, ``test_checks.py``) — neither
  is duplicated here.
- ``TestSharedRestrictedHelpText`` — T023 (US-7, FR-013): a restricted field
  with no ``help_text`` of its own describes itself as restricted within its
  vocabulary, one static default per field shared by all three axes, never
  one interpolating the restriction; an unrestricted field and a consumer's
  own ``help_text`` are both unaffected.
- ``TestRestrictionErrorMessagesAreTranslatable``,
  ``TestWriteGuardRefusalsAreTranslatable``,
  ``TestW005MessagesAreStaticWithNamedPlaceholders`` and
  ``TestDeclarationRuleTypeErrorsStayUntranslated`` — T024 (US-7, Article
  XII): every curator-facing string this feature added — the three
  ``invalid_restricted*`` messages, the many-valued write guard's three
  refusals, and W005's three messages and hints — is a static msgid with
  named placeholders, checked as lazy proxies rather than by content alone.
  The last class asserts the opposite direction: T002's and T003's
  declaration-rule ``TypeError``s stay plain, untranslated strings, on
  purpose (research.md R7).

# --- T024 (US-7, Article XII) — every curator-facing string this feature added is translatable ---
#
# Four classes below split the two directions T024 asserts. The first three cover the strings a
# curator actually reads: the three ``invalid_restricted*`` error messages (``TestConceptField*
# RefusalMessage`` above already prove their *content*; these prove they are lazy proxies with
# named placeholders, not incidentally-correct plain strings), the many-valued write guard's three
# refusals, and W005's three messages and hints. The fourth proves the opposite: T002's and T003's
# declaration-rule ``TypeError``s stay plain, untranslated strings, on purpose (research.md R7) —
# they are developer-facing diagnostics raised while a declaration is only being read, matching
# every existing refusal ``ConceptFieldMixin`` already raises the same way, and nothing renders
# them for an end user. That last point is exactly why the direction needs its own test: wrapping
# one in ``_()`` would not visibly break anything, so a later "consistency" pass could do it by
# accident and nothing here would tell it not to without this class.
