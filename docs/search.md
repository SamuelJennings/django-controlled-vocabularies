# Choosing a concept

`ConceptField` and `ConceptsField` render as a search-as-you-type control, both in your own forms
and on Django admin pages.

## Choosing a concept by typing

`ConceptField` and `ConceptsField` render as a search-as-you-type control by default. A project
declaring either gets it without naming a widget, writing an endpoint, or configuring anything
per field — an ordinary `ModelForm` built from the model already renders it.

Getting it working outside the admin takes three steps, done once per project rather than once
per field. In the order a developer does them:

1. **Include the route.** The package carries its own search endpoint in
   `controlled_vocabularies.urls`; include it once, at an address of your choosing:

   ```python
   from django.urls import include, path

   urlpatterns = [
       ...
       path("vocab/", include("controlled_vocabularies.urls")),
   ]
   ```

2. **Add `"django_tomselect"` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.** The control's templates and static assets
   live inside that package, and Django only finds another package's templates and static files
   through an installed app — no amount of work in this package moves that.

3. **Add `"django_tomselect.middleware.TomSelectMiddleware"` to `MIDDLEWARE`.** Without it, the
   control still renders, but as a plain `<select>` carrying no search box and no JavaScript at
   all — nothing errors, nothing warns at render time, and the control simply doesn't work.

Skip any of the three and `manage.py check` reports it: a missing route
(`controlled_vocabularies.W002`), a missing `INSTALLED_APPS` entry (`controlled_vocabularies.W003`),
or a missing middleware entry (`controlled_vocabularies.W004`), each naming exactly what to add.
A render that reaches the missing-route case despite the warning raises `ImproperlyConfigured`
naming both the route and the `INSTALLED_APPS` entry, rather than the underlying library's own
`NoReverseMatch` against a URL pattern you never wrote.

A search returns, per concept, its identifier, its preferred label in the active language, and the
name of the vocabulary it belongs to — nothing else, no editorial notes or alternative labels. The
results are restricted to whatever vocabularies the field declares, the same restriction that
already governs which concepts a form accepts; a field naming no vocabulary searches every concept
in the database. The endpoint carries **no permission rule by default** — it serves the same
concept data the rest of this package publishes at stable URIs. A project holding vocabularies it
does not want searched restricts the include instead, at whatever access level fits.

The control needs a browser running JavaScript. Without it, both fields still work as an ordinary
required-relation form field; only the search-as-you-type behaviour is unavailable.

## Choosing a concept in the admin

A model that declares `ConceptField` or `ConceptsField` gets the same search-as-you-type control on
its Django admin pages once it's registered — nothing further to configure. `ModelAdmin` builds the
field the same way it builds any other, and the wiring is the three steps above: the route,
`django_tomselect` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, and its middleware. The admin adds nothing to that list.

A concept is chosen on these pages, never created or edited there. Django ordinarily puts an
add, change, delete or view link beside a related field so a person filling in a form can manage
the related record without leaving it. None of the four appears beside a concept field, whether or
not this package's own models are registered in the admin, and whatever permissions the signed-in
person holds. Authoring stays wherever concepts themselves are curated — a controlled vocabulary
stops being controlled the moment a data-entry form can invent or edit one.

Where the admin presents the field read-only — listed in `readonly_fields`, or because the
signed-in person may view the page but not change it — the concept is shown by its preferred label
and no control renders. This is Django's own read-only presentation, not this package's: with
`Concept` registered, a single concept links to its own change page. Several concepts, on a
`ConceptsField`, always render as plain text. The package neither adds to this nor suppresses it.

A project can still ask for a different control the way it would for any other related field:

- `autocomplete_fields` renders Django's own autocomplete widget instead — Django requires the
  related model to be registered and searchable, as it does for any field named this way.
- `raw_id_fields` renders Django's plain identifier input, with the magnifying-glass lookup link
  Django gives every field named this way. That link opens a list to pick from — it selects a
  concept, it does not create one.
- A `ModelForm` declaring its own widget for the field via `Meta.widgets`, passed to
  `ModelAdmin.form`, renders that widget.
- `readonly_fields` renders the read-only presentation described above.

The first three still refuse the add, change, delete and view affordances, the same as the default
control, and saving and validation carry on unchanged: a concept outside the field's named
vocabularies is refused, and a legitimate one still saves.

One piece of text on these pages is Django's rather than this package's. Under a multi-value field
the admin adds *Hold down "Control", or "Command" on a Mac, to select more than one.* It is the
same sentence the admin puts under any multiple-select field, and it does not describe this
control: concepts are added by typing and picking, and removed one at a time.
